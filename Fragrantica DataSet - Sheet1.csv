But boy do I love this one. I find the name ""Adventurous"" fitting. No, it\'s not exotic as in ""wow, this smells like coconut and sunscreen"" but rather ""wow, this smells like an african safari AND a weekend in NYC at the same time"". It has this universal ""urban jungle"" feel to it. It\'s light and fresh but turns warm on my skin, as if I\'d been in the sun all day. I\'d say it\'s a woody floral that would suit a woman at any age. Transforms well from day to evening :)', ""MarillaV08/30/13 13:48Pretty bottle, but misleading. Based on the advertising, this should be a warm, tropical perfume. However, upon spraying, you are whacked in the nostrils with sharp greenness. It really stings. This initial blast does wear off, and then inexplicably I am smelling toffee mixed with white florals. At some point, fruit comes into play. Talk about whiplash. I did enjoy parts of the dry down, but it wasn't anything earth shattering. Not worth sitting through the olfactory equivalent of a roller coaster."", 'Solvita06/25/12 12:59I found this one very strange,not gourmand and all,more floral-green...', ""Habanita11/02/11 07:37I tested it today and liked it.

It doesn't have the sweetness you imagine with caramel and all the sweet scents. It's more a grown up scent. Unfortunately the staying power on my skin wasn't that great."", ""RoRoSe09/19/11 03:46Actually This is my second review here .. I deleted the 1st post because I discovered that I judged so quickly on this perfume ..\n\nThis perfume needs from you to try it twice ..\nat the first I didn't understood the notes of caramel which are not over sweet or gourmand ,, that was a new thing to my nose to smell a classY,balanced and strong caramel note at the same time, I don't smell fruits here but I can notice vetiver & musk ..\n\nThe bottle is masterpiece for me with it's golden stopper & slim design which is so reasonable for travelling & trips ..\n\nThe lasting power & sillage are normal .. just apply more if you want a concentrated smell ..\n\nThat's so interesting !"", ""Eleiria09/15/11 12:10Sweet little summer fragrance, which unfortunately isn't long lasting. At first Adventurous is a bit too green and sharp, and therefore it burns the nose. Then it turns into a fruit-juice-spilled-on-flowers kind of smell. Nothing new, and nothing adventurous for that matter, however it is likable. I also like the bottle, sleek simple design with coral and golden and that's all that is interesting about Adventurous."", ""vertigo06/24/11 13:26Adventurous to me smells a bit exotic, a suntan-lotion type of scent without typical coconut and tiare.\nI think it'll ba a popular buy in the duty frees all over the world in the holiday season.\nNice, but nothing innovative.\nEstee Lauder plays safe, not adventurous.\nDecent sillage, staying power of about 3-4 hours."", ""Inspire011105/28/11 21:51I don't get this as fruity gourmand. On me, it is straight floral. Starts out green, I thought I could detect gardenia in the beginning. As it dries down, it gets softer and a bit sweeter. Then it gets soapy and musky."", 'an.jorePipip05/16/11 00:55My colleague came to my room and showed me this perfume. It is sweet and thick, I think it would suitable for women at 30+. Nice perfume but should be very feminine person should wear this fragrance, not my cup of tea though :)', ""Aroussa04/26/11 01:50Tested Adventurous yet again at another duty free yesterday. I agree with NathalieZ - there was something sharp and scratchy in the fragrance that started to protrude after an hour or so - I even thought it was some sort of unpleasant spice, but I know now it must have been the vetiver! Didn't buy it - could not imagive using up the 50 ml bottle in a million years."", ""Aroussa04/01/11 02:08Just tested it at an airport duty free. It's a very delicately balanced floral/fruity/gourmand blend, in the sense that none of these three elements stand out, but altogether they produce a rather charming summery and delicately feminine effect. Because I need to 'live' in a fragrance for a full few hours before I can make a decision to buy it, I boarded my my flight without having bought Adventurous, and I regret it now!

Today I appreciate it for it's own spare, pungent qualities - while glorying in the fact that my intial impression was spot on! Sadly, Celadon looks like the Green Queen, one that would have made my heart sing.....\n\nI wish that companies today would more willingly present trios of fragrances with the intent to combine. The middle east need not be alone in utilizing this concept - one that eastern marketing should have seized ages ago!\n\nOne current offering comes to mind that has a similar advertising concept. Jovan Intense OUD (marketed almost exclusively in the middle east ) was recently released with a rose and an amber companion - making a legitimate trio! While I have only tested the one, I am certain that their quality is excellent for the price range. They have just become available for the US market at Fragrancenet.com, and receiving my bottle of Jovan Intense Oud has made me very happy indeed! \n\nThese is, of course, no SCENT comparison between this lovely 70's trio and Jovan's oud, amber, and rose. But it is a concept well worth investigating further, as western noses seldom realize the full potential of fragrance combinations."", ""nananessa12/20/12 21:31I used to wear this back in the late 70s when it first came out.

Mild projection and sillage for some people","[""tessture05/23/23 19:08Is of it's era but very pretty for that. The fruits and florals meld well, and the syrupy feel is tempered but I think it might be carnation? which lends a vintage makeup vibe. Nice."", 'UnearthlyApothecary11/26/22 13:13Yes it is similar to Samsara with the ylang/sandal although I find this one fruitier with a kind of sweaty, overripe feel. Upon first spraying, I notice and appreciate the hyacinth a note I always love but the ylang and fruit quickly overpower it. there is a lot going on here, but sadly, underneath it all there is that cat pee vibe that kills it for me. Samsara is a million times better and I’m not sure why anyone would wear this one when they could wear it instead. Very good silage/longevity', ""Unruly Julie10/23/22 10:21This juice is just stunning! It's warm, rich and deep, but at the same time it's light, dusty and slightly sweet. I know that it's going to be one of my very favorites."", 'Lg108/11/22 14:45The hyacinth comes through with a blast at first but then becomes suffused in a soft aura of pitted fruit (peach mostly/ less plum). I am particularly sensitive to the indoles which read very pissy/poopy on my skin so the jasmine plus hyacinth could be problematic. Thankfully, here they are well blended with other flowers (I am picking up lots of general ""rose"") so the overall effect is very pleasant. It definitely projects, two small sprays and I am in a big cloud! There is a ""soapiness"" that peeks through here and there even from the beginning which also balances out the indolic notes.Not getting much citrus or green grass. Overall a well blended, rounded perfume that does not show its\' age.', 'brokesta91106/29/22 08:00Estee Lauder Tuscany per Donna (1992) - floral sandalwood - Originally under the Aramis brand and created by #kennethruocco of Firmenich. Starts with this greenish Hyacinth, bright citruses and stone fruit. I also get waxy Aldehydes. As the perfume progresses, it resembles Samsara’s sandalwood accord, but the floral components in this perfume is definitely more complex - not focused on an individual flower, but a bouquet of Roses, Jasmine, Ylang-ylang, and white florals. As the florals tone down, an amber oriental accord becomes prominent. Such a powerful way to share the story of the Tuscan sun.', 'ATC03/12/22 01:38It was a gift from my boyfriend in the late 90s. I loved it at that time. Modern and chic. Not the regular florals but a more a woody and musky scent with a bit of depth. Loved the minimalist bottle design and colour of the juice.', 'culinaryqueen02/20/22 17:04For a woman who is confident, fun, and wants to be noticed by all, this is a great in the world of fragrance! Yes, it is an older fragrance, but it is one that should be in any wardrobe that is classy! Enough spice to bring depth to balance out the sweet peach and plum, but enough sweet to still be fun. It lasts forever on fabrics and on me. Yummy!', 'Marzag02/18/22 17:23This fragrance is vastly underrated in my opinion. I know it\'s been around for nearly 30 years, so that may be why it\'s not as appealing to teenagers and younger women. But I remember this fragrance from my youth. I remember smelling it on those scented strips in magazines when it was new, and I always wanted a bottle. I loved the original box with its floral tapestry design. As a young woman in my 20\'s, it cost a little more than I wanted to spend (back then). So, I decided that one day I would splurge a little and buy a bottle. Then I stopped seeing it around and I forgot all about it. Fast forward nearly 20 years later, and I have rediscovered it!\n\nI\'m glad it\'s still around. It\'s very lovely. It is for more sophisticated tastes...it\'s not ""girly"" like an Ariana Grande or Brittany Spears fragrance. Even my husband commented on it one day when he caught a whiff of it after coming home from work. His face lit up and he said ""I like this perfume. It\'s beautiful."" Believe me when I say that he can be brutally honest, so if he says he likes it, he really means it. If he didn\'t like it, he\'d say so. I\'m glad to see that there are some other people out there who appreciate this beautiful fragrance as much as I do.', 'SallyGirl01/18/22 15:11My husband and I were at a giant thrift/antique/garbage Mega Mall today, we go looking for whatever strange or bizarre cast off catches our eyes. He knows my obsession with perfumes and often has a better knack for spotting a stray in a sea of beanie babies and moldy Doobie Brothers records. He found a 1.7oz bottle of Tuscany Per Donna, the type pictured above with the bronze “pinky” cap. 10 dollars later and a .05 mini of Revlons Ghost Mysst, i am the proud owner. This greatly reminded me of something…not quite exact but pretty darn the same vain, Adam Levin. This is a sandalwood bomb, vanillic, peachy, and dense. It’s beautiful, I can see the hype. I’m 44 and this is not a scent memory for me, I feel like I should have smelled it somewhere as a Gen X’er? Eh! Glad I have this gem, I’ll definitely wear it and enjoy her.', 'drdgs07/02/21 06:20i fell in love with Tuscany por Donna the first time I smelt it. it is a wonderful floriental perfume that lasts well and smells divine. typical of florientals of this vintage Tuscany for Donna starts strong but mellows into a lovely powdery floral amber. I still have a vintage bottle that I use sparingly as reviews suggest that the new version is nothing like the original - so if you can get a bottle with the bronze cap in the tapestry box grab it!!', ""fragrances-fanatic01/30/21 11:02I used to wear the original Tuscany per Donna back in the 90's and early 2000's - the one with the coppery cap and box with a floral tapestry on it. I understand a new version was released in 2020 - I have not smelled it. Anyway, I recently got a sample of Belle Cherie EDT by Fragonard and I think it smells so much like the original Tuscany per Donna! Fragonard fragrances are not that expensive either. Maybe get yourself a sample of Belle Cherie EDT and see if it satisfies..."", ""vampireinlovewithscents08/08/20 22:05They dont make them like this anymore. I cant believe how underrated this perfume is. It's unbelievable. \nI have a 3.5ml miniature vintage of this & all i can say is if you dont like this perfume you definitely have a bad nose.\nKeep in mind im a male in my mid 20's wearing this so it probably smells different on me than it does on you.\n\nThe name Tuscany definitely suits this fragrance. It's so Italian. Extremely sexy! \n\nI can picture a warm cozy summer day in Tuscany. strolling in the fields of Tuscany with the love of my life. A red haired mature woman.

Definitely a little masterpiece. I see some pur parfum available online at reasonable prices, and I highly recommend it.\n\nSide note: to all the younger people who just wear what smells good to them and don\'t worry if it\'s ""age-appropriate"" or not, this is a sign you\'re a perfumista. ;-)\n\nBy the way, is it the Styrax and/or the Sandalwood, or the combination, that gives the fleeting top notes that hairspray quality that is shared by Samsara? I am of the mind that challenging top notes are more than worth the wait if the end result is something magnificent', ""Rabbette02/22/20 18:21Tuscany was my first signature scent, back on my 20s. I got it for myself at a department store, and I remember feeling so very, very grown up and classy doing so. I wore it every day and went through most of the bottle before my chemistry began to shift and it began to turn powdery on me. I was heartbroken and gave what I had left to my now sister in law. \nIt came across as a grown up, responsible fragrance. It's not whimsical, nor is it overly seductive. ( Even if I did feel like the Queen of Sheba wearing it.)"", ""Arrchv01/14/20 07:20Yesterday, I smelled Tuscany, after years looking for it in my city and brought so many childhood memories to me. It is definitely a classic, with a sandalwood perceptible several meters away and a predominant vanilla base. I liked it a lot, but it's definitely for someone older (I'm 24)."", 'Seducianne10/18/19 09:21I found a vintage edition of Tuscany. It’s just so beautiful. Indeed it is similiar to Samsara, on a bit sweeter, fruitier and less creamy vibe. It has wonderful sillage, generous but not intrusive, and longevity is also good. While not innovative as long as there is Samsara, it’s a beautiful, feminine, solar alternative.\nEdit: 16 hours later and I can still smell it where I sprayed it (on skin).', 'JNF08/08/19 12:27Just bought at Macys after wanting to try it for years. Even if this is a new formulation, I love it (Cannot compare to the original as I never tried it back in the day). Also love layering a body lotion, but cannot find the companion to Tuscany so I tried layering it with Avon Far Away body creme. Heavenly! If anyone knows where to get the Tuscany body lotion please let me know. Would love to have it too.', ""kc411607/13/19 12:54I bought the reformulation from Estee Lauder with no prior experience of the original formula. \nI found this to be an excellent compromise for Tresor. \nI absolutely adore Lancome Tresor, nearly as much as I adore the spokesmodel Penelope Cruz.\nHowever, Tresor EDP is too boozy and the projection is far too strong for me to wear most days of the year. \nSo I don't even buy Tresor. \nThis reformulated Tuscany Per Donna immediately smells slightly of bourbon, peach, grass, powder and rose. \nAfter the dry down, the beauty of the blend shines through. The distant notes of herbs projects early to mid.\nThe projection is mild after 4 hours. But that's about perfect for me. I like a mild projection because it leaves me with a sense of longing. It keeps my nose sniffing for the mysterious, avoidant beauty. \nI think others become closer to me, moving towards my physical space, because they need to get closer to the trace of the lingering scent."", 'Carolann5903/01/19 15:09The dry down is exactly like Natori by Natori on me: all plum! Very smooth, fruity and sexy. Could be worn day or night.', 'Elreno2212/17/18 08:45I bought the bold box version without knowing anything about the reformulation. I wanted a spicy oriental to add to my collection which tends to be flowery. This is a very nice full fragrance and I’m happy. It is well blended and classy. I appreciate what people have added in their reviews.', ""CoffeeLuva11/28/18 18:59Wow I forgot all about Tuscany. I wore it so many years ago back when I was just getting into fragrances. It was one of my favorites, but I've actually forgotten what it smells like."", 'annxyz10/10/18 00:43The latest version of Tuscany is a diminished replica of the former spicy oriental . I was about to buy another bottle as I used to love it. The scent is watered down, and worst of all disappears very quickly . It is hard to believe that EL is making fragrances that do not last . \n\n( I will add that EL Beautiful is still a long lasting floral that gets compliments every time I wear it out in public . I guess some “old lady “ scents still have a wide appeal ) .', 'dollusions03/15/18 09:34IMHO this is one of the most beautiful perfumes ever manufactured. It is sweet, elegant and alluring. A real keeper. I wore this a lot back in the day and don\'t know if they make it anymore or not. However there are lots of perfumes that have made a ""comeback"" and have been reformulated that are just the bare bones of what they used to be. That\'s a shame. If it ain\'t broke, don\'t fix it!', ""Tara100002/02/18 13:35Hi. I have 2 x 100ml & 1 x 50ml & 1 x 7ml bottles of vintage Tuscany.

Highly recommend!', 'Jbaule07/27/17 15:30I was gifted a bottle of this in 1993, a lady I worked for ordered Esteee Lauder products via mail order/catalog and would get scads of freebies included in her order.\n\nI loved wearing this because it was so out of the norm in comparison to what my friends were wearing.\n\nI would buy a bottle of this again in a heartbeat, everything about sings of nostalgia to me, especially the notes of carnation and peony that come through the strongest to my nose.', 'TessiiDob06/16/17 00:29I got a bottle of this way back in 1994, and loved it. Even when it ran out, I kept the bottle, because there was a teeny tiny bit left in it (which I couldn’t get out) because I just loved the smell of it so much. I was most upset when I went to get another bottle and I found out that it wasn’t being made any more. Then several years ago, I found out that Estee Lauder were making it, so I went looking on the net and found some. The box and the bottle were identical to my old bottle, and it smelled exactly as I remembered - awesome!! I haven’t worn this for a while, so I hauled it out this morning and then wondered why I had neglected it. It’s just lovely. While I get a bit of the fruit at opening, it very quickly becomes a soft cloud of beautiful, warm, spicy vanilla-amber-sandalwood, with a touch of sweetness from the carnation. There is something so deliciously warm about this – it’s very feminine, without being girly. It makes me think of a sexy little black dress, and champagne glasses, backlit by a toasty warm fireplace, just waiting to be picked up and sipped. Don’t ask me why – that’s just what springs to mind whenever I smell this. I do understand why some people think of Tresor when they smell it – they have a lot of notes in common. This, however, is more spicy. I still love it as much as I ever did.', ""rhaineclayton02/12/17 23:34This is a review for the new bottle.\nI wasn't ever going to buy this again after the last couple of times I tested it because it had become so harsh and soapy (old bottle design but Estee Lauder).\nWell, curiosity got the better of me and I found it for a good price...\nThere is a slight soapiness in there that I don't remember in the original formulation.\nIs it terrible? No.\nDoes it have the projection or longevity of the original? No.\nDoes it smell good? Yes.\nI think, if you were unfamiliar with the original formulation, you'd be quite happy with this one. Maybe even love it.\nSo, in spite of the reformulation, I am still enjoying it and glad I bought it. \nSamsara is bigger powerhouse (compared to this one's current formulation), but I've always preferred Tuscany because it doesn't have that Guerlain signature undertone."", ""LaurenBacall11/16/16 11:16Really, really not my style. Comes across as overly sweet, cloying, almost, and there's something in it that just does. not. work. for me. (I think it's the misplaced plum.)\n\nUgh. I've been known to move two (or three) seats away from people who are wearing this."", ""popeyecdl09/28/16 17:25DON'T BE FOOLED!!! Estee Lauder redesigned the bottle and the new bottle is a REFORMULATION it doesn't smell as good as the original nor last as long as the original. The new (reformulated) bottle is a rectangle, the old bottle is round like the one in the picture above with a bronzish pink cap."", ""Southern Blonde04/13/16 18:48Tuscany is a summer in Italy. It smells of fruits and flowers in a cornucopia that is this fragrance. I love fruity florals and this is a full bodied long lasting very elegant and spicy form of fruity floral unlike others I've experienced. I can totally smell the peach, the plum and grapefruit in the opening. It has those 90's fruity openings like Lancôme Tresor, Donna by Pavarotti, Yves Saint Laurent Champagne, and Oscar de La Renta Volupte. Once the fruit fades away there's a kind of strangely beautiful intermission and it's honeysuckle's turn to show off. It's a very realistic honeysuckle scent which also blends with green grass. When I saw that this scent had green grass notes in it I was curious as to how it would smell. It's like the most beautiful perfumed grass I wish my own lawn smelled like that. The fragrance develops into a floral scent of lily of the valley rose, ylang-ylang and carnation. The carnation and ylang-ylang are the flowers that most stand out not just for me but apparently others that have smelled this and worn it. A friend of mine wears this and she also smells a lot of ylang-ylang. It's a beautiful field of flowers type of smell but not in a Glade air freshner type of way at all. Nothing cheap or synthetic about it just a classy romantic gorgeous flowery smell. The dry down reveals a lot of good things: aromatic styrax and sandalwood/wood notes. Gorgeous absolutely gorgeous."", 'Pastelstreets03/27/16 14:23I wear this and I feel gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous.\nIt lasts so long on my skin, I love it.\nI will always have a bottle on me.', ""Gigi The Fashionista01/02/16 15:27Tuscany is my favorite of the Estee Lauders, a brand I was never really hooked on. I also like their classic White Linen. Tuscany reminds me of Donna by Pavarotti. They are both one of those heavy fruity florals from the 90's. Beautiful. Rich. Decadent. Indeed this fragrance whisks me away to Toscana Italy and I can hear opera, Verdi's La Traviata, playing on a Victrola in the background. I see a balcony on a villa overlooking verdant hills and lots of vineyards, cobblestone streets, flirtatious busty Italian women with long dark hair and sexy peasant women's apron and dress offering men some grapes, oranges, peaches and grapefruit. This is how the fragrance opens by the way, with those fruity notes. It's summer time and there is an intoxicating aroma of love in the air. Sophia Loren is out there among the women, and she will find the wealthy man from Rome that is here to buy some fine wine from her father, but will take her away to adventure and heartbreak in Rome. Nine flowers adorn the heart of this perfume. They are honeysuckle, carnation, orange blossom, violet, jasmine, Ylang-Ylang, lily of the valley, rose and peony. In addition there is the hyacinth in the top note. Honeysuckle is prominent and provides a honeyed warmth to this sunny floral fragrance and it has a divine chemistry with the Ylang-Ylang and orange blossom. I can smell the carnation and lily of the valley which make this fragrance rather green, in addition to the top note of green grass. It's amazing how they were able to recreate what I just described: a floral field and hills of Tuscany. At the base we have warm glowing amber, sweet vanilla, soft sandalwood, some musk and cedar. The sandalwood is perhaps the strongest note here, and this is a luxurious masterpiece of the floral chypres. I am so in love with this fragrance and love to wear it when I have the opportunity to go to Italy, to Milan for Fashion Week. This is a wonderful fragrance. I own a vintage original formula and that's what I've been reviewing. I don't know if this frag has been reformulated but if it's been reformulated I'm pretty sure it can't compare to the beauty of the original. Tuscany Per Donna. You have to go there. Enjoy."", ""b.a.denney10/16/15 09:43I have the vintage bottle, and it's lovely. If I run out, I might not buy more because the new bottles look CHEAP, and nowhere near as classy as the old bottles.

There is no way I'd pay Estee Lauder prices, and end up with a perfume not even pretty enough to leave out on my dresser. What a shame."", ""rhaineclayton07/10/15 01:47Another one bites the dust. \nI tried Samsara EDP yesterday and it was still lingering on my jacket - I'm not a fan of the underlying Guerlain smell of it but the dry down is to die for. \nBack in the day I had the Aramis Tuscany Per Donna and to me it was better than Samsara, even though they were VERY similar.\nToday I received a strip sample of Estee Lauder Tuscany Per Donna and it doesn't smell at all like Samsara anymore - it's just a harsh soapy mess. \nEstee Lauder have clearly reformulated this and destroyed it.

This is a very soft feminine scent and I love it!\n10/10', 'HeidiLynn06/02/14 18:44Oh, for the first hour, I was regretting spraying this on at the store: essence of Estee Lauder and some weird combination of carnation and dry peaches. I kept sniffing my arm, though, and realized that if I smelled further from ""the blast site"" where I sprayed, I got a much subtler sandalwood note which was promising; ditto if I didn\'t shove my arm up to my nose. Maybe EL expects perfume wearers to be more subtle than I....I think this is a fragrance I should have done the spray and walk-through approach.\n\nAfter an hour, I was impressed with the soft and very mellow sandalwood note, with a hint of fresh juicy peach. The sandalwood is like a very subtle version of EL Sensuous; much softer and with less spice, but just as lovely.

It is a little spicier, and richer than I tend to wear- I am a white floral girl- but I was given a huge bottle of this many, many years ago by a man who found it irresistible, and so I wore it, and Opium, for quite some time. I found as I grew older my chemistry changed and it was less appealing. When it first goes on I get a big hit of fruit,powder, sandalwood and Iris. As it dries it gets better on me, but stays strong and very noticeable to others. A little goes a long way.It reminds me a lot of Elizabeth Arden\'s Red Door.

I used to have a smaller bottle in my early twenties, but when I had more money available they already discontinued it in Holland. So I gave up on it back then. Then walking in the city centre of Amsterdam, I saw a little store selling vintage perfumes (a bit like treasure hunter Amarilia). And the man there had a 100 ml EDP available. It was pretty expensive, but at least I had it again! Then I used to stare at the box with the beautiful flower print and ADORE it. Years later shopping in Manhatten I saw it available in stores!

I had to order from US though, cannot find in any European store or on-line. What a shame, this is a hidden gem!\nTo me Tuscany per Donna fits better to a woody-oriental group. It is deep, woody, sexy and extremely feminine.\nI would call Tuscany as a little sister of Samsara. It is more floral and wearable than Samsara, with beutifull slightly powdery sandalwood-musky-vanilla drydown. Very long lasting and memorable. A little goes long way, don't need to reapply.

And I do mean flavor!\n\nTUSCANY, too, offers a blast of sweet rose with lots of vanilla and peach, but this fragrance has a somewhat better defined development trajectory than TRESOR. Which I suppose is fairly faint praise, since TRESOR is practically linear to my nose!\n\nTUSCANY dries down to a still very sweet but also woody-spicy layer with more depth than TRESOR, perhaps because of the panoply of other notes, most of which are simply drowned out by the peach-vanilla-plum-rose tour de force. It's funny though, I always preferred TRESOR before. Today, TUSCANY seems slightly more perfumey than TRESOR, and I love the scent of both, but they seem so very far away from the chypres I've been wearing of late.\n\nI think that's okay though.

There was something about its bracing mix of citrus and carnation that caught me off balance and held me in its spell for several minutes.

Although Tuscany provides imagination for me, I really don't like this at all. I hate hyacinth, and I am able to detect that the most out of it. I don't really get any of the fruits except for maybe the peach. I also smell carnation, and the carnation note in Tuscany reminds me of Guerlain's Terracotta Voile D'Ete, which I do like. Tuscany just isn't for me, it's a very 70's vintage fragrance (although released in 1985?). Reminds me of vintage fur coats that have been stuck in an old, stuffy closet for years covered in cobwebs.

It\'s short-lived but very strong. I wonder what it is I\'m smelling. Otherwise, I can say that Tuscany per Donna is an elegant ""grownup"" perfume, but it lacks originality in my opinion, it doesn\'t stand out sharply against the background of similar floral woody scents. The projection is mild as well as sillage.\nThis said, I\'m testing TPD on my skin, and it doesn\'t suit me, but I can see its potential - with the right skin chemistry it can be nice.']"

It\'s light and delicate with an earthy quality. This would be a priceless classic if it was ramped up a bit as in an ""intense"" version.

I am glad that it is working some magic for other reviewers, and much as I dislike giving negative reviews, I am sorry Estee but this is not \'Very\' anything - I think the formula was \'phoned in, or developed in a focus meeting; \'perfume by comittee\'\'.

Upon researching, here is what I found on that manufacturing technique (it seems just like Living Flower technology):\n\n""Nature is an inexhaustible source of inspiration. Scientists and perfumers utilize their creativity and curiosity to indentify new sources: a rare flower with an exquisite perfume, a freshly picked fruit, a spice from the other side of the world. These living scents are inimitable, ephemeral. Once a sample is chosen, its odor must be captured.\n\nFor this, scientists use the analysis technique of Nature Print®. To capture a scent, a cartridge is placed within proximity of the fragrant source, which fixes the fragrant molecules that are naturally emmited by the plant. Thus different extracts are carefully harvested which are later selected and evaluated by means of gas chromotography and mass spectrography. Thanks to Nature Print®, we can reconstruct the delicacy and complexity of an odor as close as possible to nature. Nature Print® is to perfumery what photography is to illustration.""', ""margarita.angelova04/05/15 10:41Generic white flowers perfume. Quite anonymous. I don't understand why you would wear it.

I adore the vintage like, true ""Estée Lauder"" quality of this scent. Very \'60\'s or \'70\'s to my nose (like Estee\'s original sportier scents), with notes reminiscent of the Private Collection scent which I adore...a dirty (almost perspiration smell) somehow seems to come out at the beginning which can be a bit off putting, but...wait for it...the smell of rich potting soil, grasses, salt, and flowers rush in quickly to save that (faux musk scent?) and you wind up with this narcotic scent wafting around you that somehow reminds you of anything and everything good in life from babies to rainbows, crossing a finish line of a race, sex, bike rides, hugs, a walk in a garden after it rains, camping under the stars & excellent red wine.\nIt\'s just all that is good in life wrapped in a bottle and I love it! \nBest part? All of this for around $50 bucks. \nBravo,Estée Lauder!', 'StellaTornlund05/10/17 14:50Bought Very Estee about a year ago, but haven\'t used it very much.The other day i found it again, and now I have used it couple of days in row.

Classic, cool, calm and collected but still oh so feminine. \nUnfortunately the perfume isn\'t lasting longer than about 2 hours on me.. But I don\'t care, I just take the bottle with me in my bag, even though it\'s a 100 ml.. Damn, I think my shoulder start hurting, but at least i\'m smelling nice ..

This one is perfect mine! Nor a note or ingredient to disagree with. Nothing too sweet, or too bitter, or too sour, or too fresh, or too heavy. Just as I want it. The originality and the individuality are not too bold, they present rather discreet.\nI like also the “temperature” of the scent, the image in my mind is cool dark blue lake in a warm evening, and I see the lotuses there.\nI felt in love now, but I think it will be even more spectacular during all other seasons.', ""Nikkafragrance03/30/17 11:41What a beautiful and sophisticated perfume.

Wild Elixir was launched in 2011. Top notes are Freesia, Tagetes, Violet Leaf and Mandarin Orange; middle notes are Lily-of-the-Valley, Broom, Gardenia and Jasmine; base notes are Amber, Orris Root, Musk and Sandalwood. A feeling of pure energy radiating from luminous Genet Flower, invigorating Mandarin and smooth woods are blended in lush floral, limited edition Estée Lauder Wild Elixir fragrance. An expressive, sophisticated floral texture evolves into a drydown of soft woods and lingers sensuously on the skin for an utterly dramatic appeal.
Mandarin, Marigold, Purple Freesia and Violet Leaves create a dazzling, multi-sensorial first impression. The heart is a wild expression of flowers across a spectrum of colors and scents. Wild Gardenia, Pink Muguet, Blue Jasmine and Dewy Waterlily form a multi-faceted, airy bouquet around a signature of Genet Flower, an incandescent mimosa-honey scented flower. At the end, captivating Orris, Amberwood, Musk and Sandalwood are woven together to create a drydown of smooth, sultry sensuality.
The Estée Lauder Wild Elixir fragrance is offered in a 1.7oz.(50 ml) fuchsia, stylistic bottle with crisp edges and a clear cubist cap. The sleek, architectural packaging comes in a striking pink color with gold accents to compliment the exuberance and spirit of the fragrance.
Estée Lauder Wild Elixir fragrance is presented to the market in January 2011.Read about this perfume in other languages: Deutsch, Español, Français, Čeština, Italiano, Русский, Polski, Português, Ελληνικά, 汉语, Nederlands, Srpski, Română, العربية, Українська, Монгол, עברית.","Perfume PyramidTop NotesFreesiaTagetesViolet LeafMandarin Orange

There is nothing herbal or 70s chypre about it. To me, it smells like an old bottle of Avon that’s been sitting out in the heat and sun for years, having “turned” to the point of smelling like chemical haze. I would not blind buy this, but actually get to an Ester Lauder counter and smell for yourself. What a shame. :(', 'LizzieDee05/11/19 02:40I have, and love, a number of “green” perfumes where galbanum is one part of the mix. There’s so much galbanum in Alliage, it’s a galbanum bomb.

It is different from the one pictured here, but the colour of the juice is the same. And looking at the notes i guess it is the same fragrance, i just probably have a bit of a later version, still vintage.\nBefore i first sprayed the scent i was concerned. Top notes would usually disappear with time. But the fragrance in my bottle shot me down with an unexpected but truly great burst of flowers and citrus, and i am really happy that the jasmine and rose are present and vibrant as they should be (and probably were back in the 70s / 80s) It is a few minutes short pleasure, but it's worth it, and even the fact it's there speaks about the quality of the fragrance per se.

This is such a weird scent, the oakmoss and cedar are overbearing at first, very very strong, it can almost turn you off, after 5 minutes, its mixed with the lemon, which makes the scent stranger then, because its like you're trying to make a pungent bitter scent, fresh. The blending at this stage is a little off putting, but at the same time its like I keep sniffing myself because it also intrigues me. After 1 hr, the scent finally start to blend and settle, its not overbearing now the scent softens, and you can start smelling the vetiver and nutmeg. I do smell the sportiness of it all.

So I was completely shocked when I met Azurée Soleil. No syrupy, chemical sweetness. It is a fresh, elegant, airy, sunny scent.

Very similar to the TF body oil in that coconut and gardenia are definitely the stars of the show, but AS has a tad more complexity from the florals and amber.

AS delivers a soft and wearable gardenia, tempers the citrus and amber and other floral notes with vetiver, and gives the wearer a feeling of sophistication. For me, it conjures a foray to the French Riviera, or shopping the stalls in Tahiti, or meeting a friend on a beach in Miami for a light cocktail and watching the sun set.\n\nOne spritz is great for daytime or the office. Two makes you ready to go out on the town. It's fairly unique, especially amongst today's department store offerings, and I'd recommend picking up a sample vial online.

Someone else said milky,, yep that\'s it.\nBG is a tiny bit more citrus and a bit somehow lighter ?\nBG is not quite as long lasting so more a skin sent\nYet even though AS is down as a skin scent too, it packs a tiny bit more punch than BG lingering on skin were BG dissipated a little faster.\n\nSo this is the business and it beats the goddess in certain ways as well and thats not easy with BG being sooo yummy ! The bottle to me is quaint , the blue green glass makes for summery blue skies and blue sea before you even smell its delicate fragrant beauty ,this is a keeper!\n\nTom ford said when presenting this fragrance and products , ""a collection for the woman who\'s fantasy takes her away to ,sexy , remote beaches!

The two words ""coconutty gardenia"" cannot be combined in my mind without thinking of pre-reformulation Crystal Noir, but CN reads greener and fresher to my nose, they are very different. I guess it is the caramel in this one that sweetens the deal also. Lovely bottle - very appropriate, it is a scent that reads turquoise in my mind.', ""mystica03/18/16 00:05Azuree Soleil is incredibly luxurious smelling. I believe that's the best summer-beachy frag ever done. It has a delicious salt note, a very balanced sweetness, just a fresh accord, and I agree that it's one of the best interpretations on coconut along with Tiare (Tahitian Gardenia). In short it's a successful composition. \n\nTo me however reminds not of the beaches but totally unrelated places and memories. For that reason, I can't quite classify it as a summer frag for myself (and by the way that's good for all seasons) but I definitely recommend Bronze Goddess (pretty much any edition) for the purpose since they are similar. Azuree Soleil has a touch of niche which is detectable."", ""dsty08/18/15 23:53I got a tiny amount of Azuree Soleil in a coconut sampler pack I ordered when I was a complete newcomer in the world of perfumes and didn't know where to start. I don't know why they included something discontinued; falling in love madly with a rare fragrance and hunting down a well-conserved and affordable bottle seems hardly a beginner's game! Luckily for me though, that didn't happen: Azuree Soleil is just a solid like for me, and although I wouldn't mind getting a little more of it I can definitely live without it.\n\nI can see why it's so hyped: it's a great interpretation of coconut: deliciously tropical, rich and creamy without being overly sweet. In fact it's a bit like the one I liked so much in Margiela's Beach Walk last week, only a bit lighter and without having to pass through that beachy/suntan lotion phase of white flowers and nylon first. In fact, at least in my experience, the other notes here only exist as supporting players, they add a bit more depth without getting in the way of the coconut at all, just enhancing it subtly. So yes, it's pretty much a coconut lover's dream, really perfect for summer. \n\nSo I do like this very much, but to be worth the prices it's currently going for to me, I'd have to find it earthshattering, which I don't, and a little more longevity and sillage wouldn't hurt either. I'm glad I got to test this rare bird, but I'm not going to lose sleep over its unavailability."", ""LEXIE03/14/15 04:51Don't understand this fragrance, there are so many nicer ones out there that don't cost more than a £100.

I also wear Bronze Goddess every other season since it was released as a replacement but it lacks the elegance and refinement of the original Tom Ford creation. Azuree is more creamy tiare with a hint of coconut, sea salt and spice whereas BG is straight up citrus coconut with a hint of tiare and a musky dry down.

It is like Philippine summer, by the beach, drinking fresh coconut, fresh air from the sea mixed with delicate floral notes.\n\nThis is really ""vacation in a bottle.""\n\nVery expensive in amazon, I bought mine from a local (Manila) surplus store which sells old perfume, roughly about USD40.00 for 75mL.

I managed to get my hands on a small sample and fell in love with this fragrance even more (I used it mainly during my holiday in Thailand). Couple of years ago straberrynet had it on sale for around $50 so I was beyond excited to get 100 ml bottle.\n\nFirst thing that attracted me to this Tom Ford creation is beaituful blue bottle with gold cap - lux 70's (imagine big hair, bronzed skin and designer bikini). The scent itself is a fresh mix of coconut, white flowers and citrus. The coconut note is very pleasant and subtle (none of that sweet cocnut we are use to in form of lotion or body butter). \nOverall I can't get anough of it and love wear it in summer. It smells expensive but not suffocating at the same time."", ""MarillaV08/30/13 14:00God, I am such an idiot for not buying multiple bottles of this when I could.

It is so soft and creamy, not at all ""in your face"" coconutty like some other tropical perfumes.\nThe only downside I guess, is that it lasts about an hour and a half before it\'s completely gone. I got it for a great price but if i constantly have to reapply, it\'s just not worth it.\nShould I find it for the same price again (not likely) I would def. repurchase it.\nOne thing is for sure; the bottle is so pretty I will keep it on my vanity long after it\'s empty. :)\n\n\n--\n\nUPDATE 2/3-2014\n\nI remember reading a review (somewhere on the internet) where the woman wrote that Azuree Soleil smelled like thai green curry to her. I disregarded it, it sounded too weird.\nNow that I\'ve had this perfume for a while I can say that I totally agree. No, it\'s not thai green curry ""in your face"", and yes, I still love this perfume, BUT.. There is definately lemongrass in the mix, which I find odd because that\'s something you rarely see unless your cooking with/eating it. And this lemongrass absolutely adds to the thai food feeling. It is quite annoying, actually. However, it\'s still the best coconut perfume I have come across and no one else has mentioned the ""food"" smell so I\'ll continue using it. I\'d say when I first got this perume I\'d rate the smell 9.5 out of 10 and now I\'d give it a straight up 9.\n\nSo;\n\nSmell: 9/10\nProjection: 8/10\nLasting power: 4/10', ""Clyn1102/14/13 16:33I have a lasting love for Azuree Soleil.

AS delivers a soft and wearable gardenia, tempers the citrus and amber and other floral notes with vetiver, and gives the wearer a feeling of sophistication. For me, it conjures a foray to the French Riviera, or shopping the stalls in Tahiti, or meeting a friend on a beach in Miami for a light cocktail and watching the sun set.\n\nOne spritz is great for daytime or the office. Two makes you ready to go out on the town. It's fairly unique, especially amongst today's department store offerings, and I'd recommend picking up a sample vial online.

Someone else said milky,, yep that\'s it.\nBG is a tiny bit more citrus and a bit somehow lighter ?\nBG is not quite as long lasting so more a skin sent\nYet even though AS is down as a skin scent too, it packs a tiny bit more punch than BG lingering on skin were BG dissipated a little faster.\n\nSo this is the business and it beats the goddess in certain ways as well and thats not easy with BG being sooo yummy ! The bottle to me is quaint , the blue green glass makes for summery blue skies and blue sea before you even smell its delicate fragrant beauty ,this is a keeper!\n\nTom ford said when presenting this fragrance and products , ""a collection for the woman who\'s fantasy takes her away to ,sexy , remote beaches! ""\nHe obviously knew a thing or two :) \nI suddenly fancy a bounty bar lol....\n10/10 to AS it just has something extra.\n8.5/10 to BG\n\nÉdit: still love this and noticed another difference to bronze goddess, there\'s a lemongrass or tiny bit curry smell in this ( in a good way ), it\'s easy to miss so it\'s not off putting to me, I think it gives the coconut some voomph ,but my friend preferred goddess over azurée due to that note! It\'s possible that\'s the salt note I\'m getting ?\nFor me it makes it more interesting as it\'s hard to detect really unless like me you smell it 20 times lol.', ""MiuMiuKitten07/07/17 19:46I recently discovered a sample of the Tom Ford Azuree Body Oil in my collection.

Very similar to the TF body oil in that coconut and gardenia are definitely the stars of the show, but AS has a tad more complexity from the florals and amber.

Cloying. (-)', ""LSAUG09/27/21 12:27What a pretty, delicate, feminine perfume this is. I blind bought a full size 3.4oz because I fell for the ad campaign. Call me a sucker for the Bride thing, I'm a romantic at heart. But I really do love this perfume. It is sweet, but not gourmand it is floral but all roses which my husband will love. The orange honey is just divine in this one but I think the sage keeps it from going in the gourmand territory and gives it a slightly herbal quality. This is the type of fragrance that is a workhorse in a collection since it is appropriate for all situations, and events and just everyday wear. You will smell pleasant, pretty, and tasteful. This is a very pretty peach/pink rose of a perfume.\n\nNow I remember why I like this perfume so much! It reminds me of a perfume I bought at the Asa Ransom house while on vacation w/ my husband when we were very young. It was their spa perfume. I really loved it and wore it all the time. It was years later when we went back that I asked if they still had it and they did not. This smells very close to that fragrance. Brings back good memories.\n\nEdit: 1/14/23 I have smelled a lot more perfumes since I blind bought this little beauty and I tested Love by Killian recently. If you don't want to pay the high price for Killian Love Beautiful Belle Love is a bit cheaper and has that spun sugar sweetness that Love Killian does but Beautiful Belle Love is better. There is so much more going on here that adds richness and depth to this perfume compared to Love Killian. In my opinion Love Killian is a boring type of sweetness and you can get a Jessica Simpson's Fancy (A perfume I have in my collection that is a crowd pleaser and I bought it for that reason.) and get the same caramel vibe w/out the high cost. I think the sage in BBL adds something new and keeps this perfume from becoming just another gourmand. Honey is richer and has more depth than a spun sugar/cotton candy note that is in Killian Love but the honey here is lighter, giving that spun sugar smell. Also, BBL lasts a lot longer and the sillage is massive. Bottles of these are still available on Amazon and Fragrance.net. Fragrance.net has decants as well for $13.

Perfect for girls who's going to a date and willing to look adorable. I get almond and a little honey among flowers but still there's nothing special about this frag. At the same time should admit that it's a very safe choice to wear at any occasion, this guy will not gasp people around. If you want something that is sweet, feminine and gentle go with this perfume.\nOpening to me looks like a young girl flying on a pink balloon, too cute. IMHO. Well majority would like it, especially guys.\nOn blotter dries down very synthetic-sweet, but on the skin develops in a slightly gourmand way which I appreciate. def I like drydown more than opening.

Today was the first time I smelled it up close on the skin, and I do smell all of the lovely notes in here: sweet, floral almond, and also a floral honey (like an orange blossom honey.) It's a comforting perfume, with some freshness from rose. It reminds me of lovely almond scented soaps or bath gels.\n\nThe downside to this perfume for me is that once I'm smelling the sillage of this perfume, it doesn't smell like anything special to me. Just a sweet, lightly ambery perfume. It is noticeable enough to be likeable by other people, I received a couple of compliments on it. But in the end, the trail isn't unique enough to really stand out. I'm not sure why that happens - if the amber and vanilla just take over in the scent trail so that nothing else is distinguishable.

I finally have a perfume with an old fashioned spray valve! And this bottle… just amazing!! Really a pearl on my dresser, next to my little girl’s merry-go-round and Chanel parfum. Now all I need is a diamond shaped flacon to match… \n\nI have wanted this for so long, and being in Australia it was so hard to get my hands on, since it was a US release only and sold out real quick. I don't regret the extra cost. It's one of the prettiest perfumes I've ever seen, has a lovely smell, and I'm honored to have it in my collection. \n\nI also have the original Beautiful in a mini. So I did a wrist comparison, and this is what I found: \n\nOld formulation definitely due for a remake. It smells dated. An unmistakable big 80s floral which would never be considered for a bride nowadays. Despite this, I actually prefer it, because it’s rounder, deeper and more complex. It also hits the spot for my vintage cravings. \n\nThe reformulation is almost entirely new. Still a big white floral, but a vintage “mood” is about as close to the original as you'll get. More modern and wearable. Although the complexity is missing. It smells like ivory satin and pearls to my nose. Not as lush, more sheer. Aldehydic and citric top notes give it a Chanel vibe, though I would not put it in that class. The base is different. Softer. Less “yellow” in the mix. Barely woody. Overall, it's good, satisfying. \n\nTo me, the reformulation is a compromise between market demands and the legacy of the old Beautiful. They've significantly changed it, yet there's some faint resemblance to this classic, classic powerhouse. Not bad… but let me put it this way: if Beautiful was released for the first time in its reformulation state, it would not be a classic. It would be another Modern Muse."", ""Sherihan03/05/16 05:48Purchased it last night, I'm a big lover of the classic version, this smelled little different, maybe more citrusy and less longevity.

It’s unusual for me to like such an intensely floral fragrance but I find this different than the run of the mill florals. The tuberose really sings in this one and keeps it interesting, it reminds me a little of Michael Korrs edp which is also rich in tuberose, but this one doesn’t give off that banana-like smell.\nAt first spritz this is really quite potent and a little overpowering for me but after 5 minutes it settles down lovely and lasts all day. \nUnfortunately it’s discontinued now but I occasionally see it on eBay etc for anyone still interested in trying this.', ""drugstore classics06/03/21 22:02Lovely flanker.

If you don't like flowers you can forget about it. This is a delicious sweet floral perfume for women who appreciate flowers. Can you imagine living on a planet devoid of flowers? So this fragrance starts off smelling floral right away. Magnolia! Yes! My favorite flower opens the show. There is a sweet mango as well. The scent is sweet but not cloying. The other flowers include: violet, tuberose, carnation, rose, jasmine Tiare and heliotrope. For whatever reason these flowers are a winning combination. Smells so good when put together. My 3 favorite flowers are in this perfume: magnolia, rose and Tiare. The result is luxurious lush and decadent but being a modern take on the first one less intense and more subtle. In fact I find myself reapplying and dousing myself with it many times throughout the day because I want to keep smelling this scent which is soft and barely detectable and has a short life. I do love it very much. It's a spring time floral fragrance for women who want to smell good. The dry down is also as good as the other moments in this perfume. It smells of vanilla (Tonka bean is vanilla) and of heliotrope as well as oak moss. However this does not wear like a traditional chypre. It's not woodsy enough. It's flowers for days.

He was always pushing me to wear big 80s florals - his favorites being red door and beautiful. I\'m a fan of big florals, but I just didn\'t like this one.

Comparing these white florals to wedding dresses, I would say that wearing Fracas is like wearing a vintage 1930s silk ""siren"" dress, the kind with a fitted waist and body hugging draping. Wearing Carnal Flower is like wearing an artsy edgy wedding dress, like a Gaultier design. Wearing Beautiful Love is like wearing a Vera Wang. Simple, feminine, timeless, youthful, and elegant.

I think it's really feminine, romantic and girly, because of the fruits which can be found here, but all in all this is a pleasure to my nose and my skin. This was a lovely surprise from another member who put this in our sample swap. \nWhat I love the most is that at the heart phase the earthy violet appears, so it makes everything even more perfect as I love violet. \n\nAhh, I can't even judge this.

Beautiful Love is more of a fruity floral whereas the original is strictly floral. \n\nThe sales assistant told me that this fragrance is the younger alternative to the original, which I'd have to agree with. This fragrance is surprisingly pretty and nicely balanced. It may be a little overpowering initially with its fruity notes, but the drydown is absolutely exquisite. It becomes a soft and feminine blend of tuberose, jasmine and rose. The tuberose gives this fragrance that tropical and coconutty like scent.\n\nThis fragrance actually makes me feel quite happy when I wear it. It's not like anything that I usually wear; it's not overpowering, sexy or daring. Instead it's more of a sweet and romantic type of scent. It could quite possibly be the signature fragrance for falling in love. \n\nThe lasting power is fantastic and unlike most florals, this scent won't leave you smelling musty at the end of the day."", 'Trinity03/13/09 07:39My boss gave this to me as a Christmas present about a year ago.

It is like a loud noise you cannot escape from…(like road work outside your office)…\n\nAlthough, I like the original Beautiful fragrance, this one is not for me to wear…!\nNow I use it as a air freshener ….and for this, it works quite well….:-)', ""Taliera10/19/08 04:00It's beautiful but obnoxious - it hangs around for hours and hours, intruding into everything you do.

He was always pushing me to wear big 80s florals - his favorites being red door and beautiful. I\'m a fan of big florals, but I just didn\'t like this one. I wore it for him, every now and then, but it was sharp and loud, like wearing bug spray to me. After we broke up, I put this in a box along with all the other gifts he gave me and forgot about it.\n\nI discovered it again today and put it on. Wow, I am completely in love. Maybe it\'s the weather, maybe my skin chemistry changed, who knows, but now it\'s absolutely gorgeous and creamy and beautiful on me.\n\nWhen he gave it to me, I used to wear Fracas and Carnal Flower all the time. Comparing these white florals to wedding dresses, I would say that wearing Fracas is like wearing a vintage 1930s silk ""siren"" dress, the kind with a fitted waist and body hugging draping. Wearing Carnal Flower is like wearing an artsy edgy wedding dress, like a Gaultier design. Wearing Beautiful Love is like wearing a Vera Wang. Simple, feminine, timeless, youthful, and elegant. It\'s the dress that everyone would love and remember well into your 25th anniversary. The ""nice"" classic dress that you originally tried on but overlooked.

Vote for Ingredients","['GoodVibrations11/01/23 17:29The notes listed in the pyramid are beautiful, but in broad brushstrokes what I get is: \n• Iris \n• Magnolia \n• Oud wood \nIt is sensual and beautiful. It lasts for many hours but it stays light and wearable enough that it’s likely to be welcome almost anywhere. It stays brisk and slightly astringent, just as Beautiful Belle does. This quality makes it smell clean. This is my favorite Beautiful Magnolia flanker by far.', 'ChelleBelle8410/13/23 16:26I do really like this scent a lot. This intense version is definitely different as compared to the original Beautiful Magnolia..For starters, the only thing I smell in the opening is the iris note that comes out straight away. If there is cardamom here, I’m not picking it up. I do like it in Marsala chai so it isn’t something I hate. I must say, you must be an iris fan to enjoy this scent. It is quite dominant here. For those who are not familiar with the smell of iris, people describe it as waxy, plastic-y, doll head, and vintage lipstick. It’s a bit spicy here, ah there’s the cardamom. I love vintage lipstick so this would be right up my alley. \n\nAs it dries down, it can be a bit of a lavender, warm spicy scent, but not manly, just a bit spicy. It stays that way through the rest of the wear. I wear another scent that is similar with a more vanilla scent in the dry down. This could work as a day scent and that one for an evening in winter. It really doesn’t get cold here that much. A few cold snaps, but otherwise more like how fall weather is in colder climates. So this will wear nicely here. Longevity is good as well. I’ll use the rest of my small bottle and think about it since I got some compliments already on this.\n\nI don’t find this weak at all. If a perfume is strong enough that you can smell it hours later on yourself without raising your wrist to your nose, you may have sprayed too much. When I got compliments from my co workers, one of them was after my wearing it for 4 or 5 hours. The next one was about and hour or two later. So the longevity is decent. I sprayed it around 6:30 in the morning, and came into the office around 11:00. I couldn’t smell it anymore after the first hour, but they (my co workers) could, but not strongly. Just enough to tickle their noses and make them want to come closer. That’s exactly how it like it.', 'Celestial Bleü6605/24/23 04:36Its pretty. Powdery. More of an iris type scent.\nUnfortunately, Weak, silage and longevity. Especially for the price. This surprised me. Lauder perfumes are known for their power and longevity.\nThis is NØT a rich, creamy, heady magnolia. Powdery slightly floral. It is pretty. But, Intense this is not.', ""saho9304/03/23 13:19I am not a fan of OG Beautiful Magnolia because it is too aquatic and perhaps ozonic. This is slightly better. A bit more concentrated and as the moniker implies intense. Not great, but not bad either. Maybe I don't like the violet note or the dry down much. But it is still competently formulated."", ""Emera1d04/03/23 04:44Sprayed on a tester card and it does start with an amazing strong iris. Luckily I couldn't smell the cardamom. Sadly the iris fades in the first 30 min to an hour and what's left is a gentle floral smell, maybe a little musky. If the iris lasted longer I would buy a bottle. Might get a spray sample and see how the iris lasts from a spray."", ""lisl04/01/23 21:56Love this. Get a subtle note of tuberose - done the most gentle way I've found in any fragrance.

Intensely fruity on the initial spray, but it quickly transforms into a comforting woodsy floral. I agree with others who say the patchouli here is clean; it brings in a bit of green freshness without ever veering into marijuana territory. \nAll in all, this is a very well-rounded and inoffensive scent.

I have seen it come out at Christmas before."", 'Lipsticksuzie12/30/22 17:59I wish I could go back in time and buy a large bottle of this before they discontinued it. I enjoyed wearing this in the summer. It’s such a sharp, crisp scent. The floral notes are so green and light. I don’t know how they managed it but the fragrance would last for hours and hours, you would never expect this performance from such a light airy perfume. \nWould be nice if Lauder would release some of their discontinued perfumes as limited edition every once in a while.

Sheer doesn't consist of your typical 3 notes. Underrated and underused enough that you won't smell like everyone else. Sure, there's hints of some mainstream scent, but it's unique in that you can't quite place it. Less sweet than typical florals, fresh like pink champagne with little fizzy, carbonated bubbles. It's gotten compliments each time I've ever worn it. The only complaint is the silage."", ""Polyester Girl09/01/18 16:51This has a slightly sharper lily than Baiser Vole edp, but similar enough to bring Baiser to mind. There is also a beautifully blended floral base that is suggestive of Romeo Gigli's edp - the flat disc bottle with the spiral lid. Together, Beautiful Sheer becomes a light hearted and playful spring floral. \n\nNo soapiness of the original Beautiful, and not much to indicate a family DNA. I think this a fruity floral due to the hefty pear note. The name is a misnomer, as Sheer isn't like Beautiful and certainly isn't sheer in sillage and longevity. \n\nThat all said, I am pleased to add it to my collection. It is perfect as a work scent on warmer days and a decidely easy choice for lazy Sunday brunches."", 'Beautiful_Lover08/14/18 18:22I was on Estée Lauder’s website it seems as Beautiful Sheer has been discontinued.

Sadly Sheer And Love never was popular.', 'NoelleNice05/18/18 22:01A light, bright and crisp white floral with a touch of sweetness. I love this scent and I only need one or two sprays to get great (but non-suffocating) silage and longevity. This is a surprise love and I don’t see many people here talking about it, but I rate it among my favourites. For me there are no stand-out notes because it’s blended beautifully into an airy, floral and green accord. The fruit notes give it a subtle sweetness without it actually smelling too fruity on me. It has a slight clean sharpness to it that I love and that I think makes it more sophisticated and less playful than it would otherwise be. To me it smells expensive and classy in a way that I might expect would suit smart business or cocktail attire in spring and summer. This is my favourite from Estée Lauder, and I do enjoy this house overall.\n\nEdit: I’m wearing this today in 45 degree Celsius (113 degrees fahrenheit) summer heat and it has burned off all other notes except extreme, honey-like mimosa that I don’t usually get so much of on my skin. I prefer this in slightly cooler weather now.', ""mutintabailey03/10/18 03:39This is such a clean crisp fragrance.\nAny age can wear this and so strong but powerful in his presence, lingers on clothing and skin amazingly!\nThis is the like the ice cool aid on a summers day the smell is just refreshing clean and sheer!\nIt's a all rounder (Excellent blind buy)"", 'addiehominem12/17/17 22:19Lives up to its name. A light lily bouquet that smells freshly cut, with dew dotting its petals. Surprisingly refreshing for a white floral; the pear in this is ripe, watery, and soft. I would wear this on hot summer days I wanted to feel feminine without choking on fumes. Becomes musky and slightly more sensual as it sinks into skin--I like it more as it dries down.

It's interesting that people put rose, peach and pear as the top notes because once this sits on your skin I smell mostly Magnolia (slightly citrusy) with the Linden Blossom more than anything. I guess most people might not know exactly what that smells like.\n\nThis does have a sourness to it but it's fresh and floral citrusy sour and not sugary citruses with pomegranate sour. Really quite Beautiful (I know)"", ""bosem01/12/15 16:29Tried it when it was released.

(It had quite a bit gone out of it which was how I knew it was a tester)\nEither way, I sprayed it on the little piece if paper and smelled. Now personally it was a nice scent, but no where NEAR as good as the original. The original seems to invoke a romantic encounter, Sheer is more for a summer day casually but still nicely dressed day at a classy mall with a slight tropical theme. But I still rate it 7/10 on the smell. Also, to my nose it smelled very light when compared to the Beautiful eau de parfum."", ""JaxTheMinx09/21/13 03:00I have worn Beautiful for many years and loved it. Then I discovered Beautiful Sheer when it was launched. I prefer the Sheer version. A light, sweet floral scent which is perfect for a hot summer's day under the African sun.

It's just the right amount of sweet. :-) It's a playful fragrance suitable for a fairly wide audience."", 'ArtzGirl09/21/13 02:48This fragrance lasts and lasts on my skin.

It has good silage - and stays on extremely long. This is a plus, particularly on days when you are having to attend a long meeting or won\'t have time to refresh throughout the day.\n\nThis is a fresh and clean type smell. It is probably one of those fragrances that you could wear for a number of different occasions. It is soft, feminine, with an upbeat lift - almost like a singer with a lilt in their voice.\n\nI sprayed this tonight with about 6 other Estee Lauder fragrances. This wins the most lasting. It wears the longest and is the most detectable even 8 or so hours after spraying.

The first time I tested it I was sure that I was going to purchase it. I did but I was in college and for some reason I think I may have been wearing this fragrance wrong. I may have been overspraying. I was wrecking the fragrance without even recognizing what I was doing. I ended up returning it to Macys.\n\n2nd encounter: I told my mom that I wanted Beautiful Sheer for christmas one year after testing it again. I got it, but sadly I was pregnant this time around and it just repulsed me. I gave a full bottle to my bestfriend.

Lol. I also suspect that one of my friends that I met in college use to wear Beautiful sheer and she would smell so nice. Very bright, fresh, soapy, pink floral that is very inoffensive.

Not too special, no, but even though I appreciate perfumes, they don\'t always have to be overwhelming and extrovert.\nWhen the girls used to put on Wish or Angel after sports or at lunch break, I had always imagined they had something to ""hide"" underneath, like smelly sweat or maybe just their lacking personality. Actually, fragrances are supposed to mix with your own smell and not suffocate it. \n\nStill, until today, I am a big fan of sophisticated, clean and minimalistic scents. With this you can\'t go wrong, try it out and you will instantly feel younger without smelling like cotton candy.', 'LuluCoconut05/07/11 09:16This is somehow similar to Clinique Happy in Bloom and they do share a lot of the notes. Nice floral green, optimistic and inoffensive.\nOn second applying I found the one thing that disappoints me the most. The opening notes are just too much, too strong, too messy. This EDT just seems unfinished to me, as it lacks that smooth flow of notes proper to even not so remarcable fragrances. To me it misses the development and goes straight to an undefined drydow, prominent in mimosa.\nGood silage and lasting power, but failed to convince me.', ""chrisstinna_b04/15/11 11:58I think this would be an example of how lily and lime don't match. \nI can feel the lily, which is beautiful, but I can't only focus on lily when lime says: Hello, I'm here too!\nI thought I'd like it, since is Estee Lauder and since is floral green, but it seems I was wrong.

Mostly because I really like the bottle. It\'s simple but some how clean and classic, and I like the pale pink color of the perfume with the silver cap. Whatever works!\n\nAnyway, the verdict=good! I will have to plagarize here and say that when ""The Guide"" authors reviewed this EDP as ""pear shampoo"" they were spot on. It starts of with floral-citrus topnotes, grapefruit around the edges that I wish would last longer-but citrus never does...then the heart is a very sweet but not sugary pear. I think of someone with fine, soft, straight, dark wheat colored hair who just got out of the shower and leaves a trail of her nice shampoo behind. (This, of course, does not resemble my hair in the least.)\n\nBeautiful Sheer is a nice fruity floral, feminine and pretty, that I would reach for whenever I have to be in close quarters with others and I don\'t want to offend, or when I simply don\'t know that to wear that day. This isn\'t the most interesting perfume, but it works well, and I ended up buying a 1 oz. bottle of it a few days later. \n\nI guess it varies from person to person, but if you have an opportunity to test it out on your skin for the day, give it a try. And keep in mind that it does change quite a bit in the first hour or so.\n\nEDIT: \n\nAlas I had to ebay this one. It became cloying and horribly synthetic after a few wearings. And unbearably linear, as if the scent of a hair gel intensifies with wear and never goes away. \n\nI can still see how people like this, and no, I never got the pee/vinegar thing, but it ended up not working nonetheless.', ""sunshineandroses07/20/10 13:30I like the floral part of this but there a sharp note in there that stings my nose. I see vinegar, cat urine mentioned above but to me it was like something that sets off hay fever. One of the notes is too strong for me. I use just a little of it away from my face and it's okay.

""Sweet and fresh"" is a good description; I\'ve always like fresh florals and Beautiful Sheer is full of floral notes I find refreshing and pretty: mimosa, lily, and linden blossom. Freesia is not listed, but I seem to smell it. The woody notes are very transparent, and the scent stays floating on top of them.\n\nWould be suitable for younger girls who don\'t like the ubiquitous fruity scents now in fashion, as well as for women of any age who like delicate florals that don\'t grab one by the nose and yank.', ""missk03/19/09 00:45Prior to testing this fragrance I was almost certain that the sheer version of Beautiful would smell just like the original only lighter, like an EDT. I was wrong. \n\nBeautiful Sheer is like a fresh burst of youth and femininity. Although I quite like the original Beautiful, this perfume seems to appeal to me more due to my young age. I would recommend this fragrance for Spring and Summer months, as it is light, fresh and inoffensive. The fruity and flowery notes in this fragrance have been perfectly blended, creating something that is both pleasant and versatile. It would be difficult to find anyone that found this fragrance offensive. \n\nI don't think it was Estee Lauder's intention for this fragrance to be considered a masterpiece, which it definitely isn't. However, I consider it a fragrance that captures many desirable elements, such as being fresh, clean and easy to wear. I believe that every woman should have at least one fragrance in their wardrobe that is pretty, casual and refreshing like Beautiful Sheer. It could quite easily become a signature scent or a fragrance that you turn to when you can't decide what else to wear."", ""ophelia09/26/08 13:07On me it's just an optimistic, light rose oil. \nFeminine, no doubt."", 'bloomia09/28/11 11:32this used to be my happy-scent in my teenage years.

Actually, fragrances are supposed to mix with your own smell and not suffocate it. \n\nStill, until today, I am a big fan of sophisticated, clean and minimalistic scents.

It's just the right amount of sweet. :-) It's a playful fragrance suitable for a fairly wide audience."", ""GeorgiaMoxie08/20/15 16:28I love Beautiful Sheer.

Really quite Beautiful (I know)"", ""Crystallight10/07/18 03:47Nothing like original Beautiful imo. Sheer doesn't consist of your typical 3 notes. Underrated and underused enough that you won't smell like everyone else. Sure, there's hints of some mainstream scent, but it's unique in that you can't quite place it. Less sweet than typical florals, fresh like pink champagne with little fizzy, carbonated bubbles. It's gotten compliments each time I've ever worn it.

I instantly recognized the scent. It transported me right back to Cancun or a caribbean cruise where I must have smelled it repeatedly on any number of vacation goers at the time. While on vacation I had no idea what I was smelling, just that this was what paradise smelled like. This was the beach and a strawberry daiquiri and pina colada side by side. This was the sun and the water and the sand. For me this is the ultimate vacation scent.

It\'s tropical, but not immature or too ""young"". Musk isn\'t listed, but I think that the base notes are really what make this scent what it is. It\'s able to be a summer scent without being cloying, or smelling like you dumped fruit punch all over you. \n\nThe coconut, amber, and caramel combine nicely to give a warm base to the tiare and jasmine flowers. My skin tends to skip opening notes completely, and settle immediately into the dry downs, so I don\'t smell too much of the bergamot, or orange, although I do get a splash of citrus immediately after spraying, though it seems to dissipate quickly.\n\nIt makes me think of a hot summer night, sipping a nice cool drink on a patio of an ocean-side restaurant.\n\nThe packaging is precious.

A very carefree scent, the coconut notes combined with jasmine are adorable. Very long lasting too!', ""salmonelle11/28/13 11:23J'ai testé mais je sens une note verte qui me rebute totalement!"", 'Bluemarinejosephine11/26/13 03:28The sun on your bronzed skin, the tiare flowers in your hair and the carefree, summer mood in your heart; plus, a fragrance to embrace all these in its scent and will revive your beautiful summer memories every time you wear it. This is what the “Bronze Goddess” seems to aspire to be and, to an extent, might actually succeed (for some).\n\nBefore I proceed with a review of the ‘Bronze Goddess” by Estee Lauder I have to admit that I am not a fan of the Estee Lauder fragrances but, I am by no means biased. To me, most of the Estee Lauder fragrances have a beautiful, elegant, fresh and discrete feel which is all very nice and they are ideal if you are stuck in the elevator with a few of your colleagues on the way to the office. Yet, that’s all they are; nice, fresh scents. There is no “va va voom” factor; that element that makes the fragrance (and you) unforgettable.\n\nAnd, boy, do I like “va va voom”!\n\nHaving said that, the “Bronze Goddess” is one more fragrance that falls into this pleasant yet somewhat indifferent category of perfumes.\n\nMy initial reaction to the fragrance is “hmm… too much alcohol”, it evaporates quickly though. The fragrance opens up with strong mandarin, orange and bergamot notes that are easily detectable and quickly weaken to give room to an oily ylang ylang note to develop.\n\nYlang Ylang is not of my favorite notes; quite the contrary. It feels oily, dump and artificial (somewhat like a lighter version of Castrol car battery oil).\n\nAccording to the fragrance’s pyramid, there is no ylang ylang note so, I suspect that it is the combination or amber and myhrr that gave me this impression. This oily ylang ylang resembling note stayed on my wrist for a good one hour (while I was wondering “where is the creamy, coconut smell?”\n\nAfter this hour, the note weakens and the fragrance develops its full potential transforming into a pleasant, clean, caramel, flower scent. I cannot feel the coconut at all and neither can I feel the jasmine and it does not feel creamy or oily. It is moderately sweet, moderately fresh, moderately warm; and it is very discrete. \n\nIt is actually so discrete that it is undetectable, I cannot even feel it there unless I persistently smell my wrist.\n\nDuring the next hour, it is completely gone so, I have to replenish by spraying again.\n\nAll in all, what the “Bronze Goddess” gives is a pleasant scent but only at the last hour of its overall 3 hour duration. It is not a scent that I would classify as distasteful or unpleasant. Nevertheless, I would not recommend it because the longevity is poor and you can enjoy the actual development of the scent only for about an hour before it completely fades away.\n\nThe bottle is cute, colorful, sparkly and feminine but, that is not a good enough reason to buy a fragrance.\n\nIn my view, this purchase won’t disappoint but, it may not be the fragrance that I would consider as a priority to purchase it again. (In fact, personally, I won’t).\n\nEnjoy the perfume quest!', 'saintleegray09/25/13 16:30I have this in the oil spray, and while I love it, I am not smelling any of the coconut notes in it at all.

I was very much reminded of Light Blue when wearing this.', 'supergirl8322104/24/13 10:25As i own the BG fraiche skinscent 2013, i was looking forward to test this. There is bergamont and mandarin there as you spray it on at first. The coconut makes it way on top of the other notes and when it finally reveals itself fullt, you get this oh so creamy, smooth coconut. There is a hovering woodiness around it but the coconut is the star in this.

It was too weak, like one of the weakest scents I've owned. It was so pretty though...it was a tough decision."", 'Wristsniffer05/13/12 00:43I fell hard for BG because it\'s like nothing else I\'ve ever smelled. At first, the blast of coconut is a bit shocking, but just when you think things are going to veer into pina colada territory, the fragrance settles and the tiare and citrus notes manage to breathe unique life into the scent. I tested this because based on the reviews, I thought it would be the perfect summer skinscent - i.e. something that would just mix with my chemistry to make me smell good without smelling perfume-y during the warmer months. I ending up buying BG (two bottles in fact), because I found it managed to smell beachy and satisfy my suntan-lotion craving, but also because it was surprisingly not a skinscent to my nose at all. The tiare, sandalwood, bergamot and mandarin make this the most luxurious, yet subtle, warm weather perfume I\'ve ever smelled. I do wish it lasted longer, and perhaps this is why it\'s labeled a \'skinscent\' as opposed to an eau de toilette, but while it hums along, it makes everything brighter and happier. Wear it on a warm day to make the most of it\'s projection potential. The coconut in BG is very light and not syrupy and vanilla-laden like the Hawaiian Tropic tanning oil, which smells as much of banana and vanilla as it does coconut.\n\nMy sister\'s first reaction to this was, ""It smells like Aunt Trisha!"" who is an aunt of ours who has always worn Estee Lauder make-up. This made me realize that there is a definite, powdery, cosmetics-scent vibe that holds everything together in BG and gives it that luxurious feel.', 'katemcq05/10/12 14:56This would be a good perfume for people who are new to the world of perfume, or who like natural scents; the creamy, toasted coconut scent seems familiar, warm, soothing, and friendly. For me, it might be a good casual day perfume - not for work or evening. Not sure I like it enough to buy - it is a bit uninteresting.', ""sunnyshine05/09/12 02:36I like this perfume because it smells like beach and the sea and recklessness and cappuccino fredo together with a novel while sunbathing at a golden beach in a greek island with the indigo water splashing on our feet and the salt on your arms.. BUT at the same time its not the usual heavy coconut cream smell that is too heavy to cope.

The initial spray reveals sweet coconut and suntan lotion. The drydown allows the coconut sweetness to settle down just a bit and reveals subtle floral notes. It\'s a suntan lotion-y, summery beachy scent that is perfect for the summer. \nThe only misgiving I have about this scent is the short-lived lasting power. Being ""eau fraiche"" or a ""skin scent"" after an hour, the scent is fading fast, and within 2 hours, you really have to sniff to get any hint of the scent at all. This requires multiple sprays per day as a refresher.

Even then there seem to be multiple versions so it is what it is. \n\nIn any case, it starts out as a very flat jasmine along with a little coconut, but then sharpens up a bit with some mild citrusy notes. Then it quickly lapses back into flatness again. For some reason I was expecting more, probably because I’d read a lot of raves about it. \n\nFrankly, I don’t get it. It’s not even a particularly good rendition of jasmine and coconut, so I must conclude that the raves were for a different version than the one I have. It stays pretty much linear for a few hours, after which some musk develops along with the jasmine-coconut mix.

Terrible!', 'kelly7605/09/11 10:09It was so long that I wanted a fragrance that smells of summer and sun so even today I bought Bronze Goddess and I agree with Lizaan: The top notes are citrusy, but after a few minutes they become hot and round like the skin to sun. The trail is one of exotic flowers and sun milk but it is not intrusive, I find it elegant and discreet but original, I have nothing like that ... it will splash a lot during the hot summer!', ""lizaan05/09/11 08:43Finally bought this today since it came out in stores today here in Sweden. Had been excited for it a long time, altough I love this summer fragrance it's a bit overpriced here in Sweden (like everything else) I think it's like twice as expensive compared to what it costs in the US. I'm not sure if it's actually worth it but I couldn't walk out the store without buying anything haha. And I mean it's a huge bottle so it'll probably last me a while.\n\nSo what about the scent, I think in the beginning it's a bit too citrusy but after a few minutes it gets a bit warmer and a lot nicer. I really adore this when it has lingered on my skin a while. The dry down is in my opinion worth waiting for, so gorgeous. When I smell this I wanna go on a vacation somewhere exotic where you eat fresh fruit on the beach and tan all day.\nWill definitely use this during hot summer days!\n\nAnd I love the bottle! It looks great, love the gold sparkles!"", 'melisb04/24/11 01:21i hated it, nothing like azuree :(\nbronze goddess is better', 'orchid_8404/22/11 00:55This is a beautiful summery-beachy fragrance that doesn\'t turn overwhelmingly sweet or synthetic the way that many coconut scents do. Bronze Goddess is full of warm, natural-smelling coconut, but the coconut does not drown out the other facets of this fragrance. The floral notes are soft and buttery. While the tiare is the strongest floral in this, the neroli also combines nicely with the bergamot to give a light citrus touch to the fragrance. The amber, vetiver and myrrh add a touch of earthiness, hinting at the feel of suntan lotion on sun-warmed skin. \n\nBronze Goddess is wonderful and creamy, with a warm caramel drydown that never gets too sweet. True to it\'s name, this is definitely an ""eau fraiche/skinscent,"" so the lasting power is somewhat limited. This is one of those scents I need to spray a lot of in order to fully enjoy. Bronze Goddess is truly like ""a summer day at the beach"" in a bottle.', ""onebadbaby04/21/11 09:55Love love love love, happy happy happy.... coconut, beach, holiday fragrance, can't stop spraying! wsh it lasted longer...x"", ""Cherub57304/15/11 23:42I agree with Katya below that it smells like sex and sunscreen. It's been a while since I fell so hard and fast for a fragrance. It's floral tropical, not fruity tropical. It lasts, but is not overpowering. Warm and sweet, but not in a way that is too spicy or sugary. I need this. I have tried Bronze Goddess in the past (around 2008), but it didn't hook me like this one does, I'm not sure how, but this one is softer, I don't smell the vetiver as much."", 'KatyaTheFabulous04/11/11 22:46it smells just like sunscreen and sex.

I can't wait to check this one out and see if it is as good as the original."", 'LemonCake05/22/19 14:43Bronze Goddess is a summer solution for persistent gourmand lovers. It is pretty linear on my skin - coconut with a sun-lotion vibe through and through, although the drydown reveals some white florals for me. \n\nThis perfume is very good at what it does - it manages to be sweet without getting nasty or cloying, maintaining its role as a summertime fragrance.', 'AveParfum03/11/12 19:13How did they do it? It\'s sunscreen in a bottle--without smelling cheap and fake. It\'s actually probably the driest coconut perfume I\'ve ever smelled. I was sick of ultra-sweet coconut like Miami Glo, Reb\'l Fleur...so I figured Bronze Goddess would be the same. I was so wrong. It\'s completely mature and is very much a skinscent, not ""perfumy"" per se. It reminds me of sexy bodies in skimpy bathing suits tanning under the hot Mediterranean sun, skin glistening with coconut oil. It\'s very sexy and a heck of a lot of fun!!', 'caitrun07/29/16 08:05For anyone confused by the gardenia smell, but no gardenia note, tiare is a type of gardenia. So what you are smelling is tiare :).', 'dkny2704/20/12 06:54Always open to try a fragrance that boasts coconut. This one on me bears traces of coconut within the layers but I get a compiled group of tropical notes, with the tiare flower most prominent. The tiare is strong enough to carry itself on top and the tropical is a sensuous tropical, not a super pina colada sweet. \nVery summery, very warm and relaxing. Makes you feel like you have a sun kissed tan.', ""smedmark03/01/15 21:08I smelled this for the first time yesterday, or should I say what I believed was the first time. I instantly recognized the scent. It transported me right back to Cancun or a caribbean cruise where I must have smelled it repeatedly on any number of vacation goers at the time. While on vacation I had no idea what I was smelling, just that this was what paradise smelled like. This was the beach and a strawberry daiquiri and pina colada side by side. This was the sun and the water and the sand. For me this is the ultimate vacation scent. I bathed in it all day today and yesterday hoping to feel a little more of the caribbean sun on my skin under the flat fluorescent lights at work. It's only $65 for the 3.4 oz bottle. The only downside is that it doesn't seem very potent."", 'MadMadamMimm06/20/15 17:19Smells of buttered popcorn. If you layer this with Angel, I bet it is just like a night at the movies. Not unpleasant, but too gourmand for me.', 'ellina198404/20/14 00:47I had very high hopes for this one, and was particularly looking forward to the coconut note. It started off quite oily, as other reviewers have suggessted. There was a very prominent bitter note, which I gather is the myrrh. If I breathe on my wrist, I get the coconut - suntan lotion note, which I like, but unfortunately I would have liked a ""sunnier"" version, with less bitterness (as in ""sensuous nude"", in which the coconut if gorgeously done). If I were to use it, I think it would be more appropriate for evening use, because of the oiliness, which makes it a tad heavy for the daytime.', 'Doc Elly12/29/11 09:14Given that Bronze Goddess seems to be reincarnated in a different form every year, I’m not sure which one my sample is, but I’m guessing it’s the 2010 or 2011 non-flanker vintage. Even then there seem to be multiple versions so it is what it is. \n\nIn any case, it starts out as a very flat jasmine along with a little coconut, but then sharpens up a bit with some mild citrusy notes. Then it quickly lapses back into flatness again. For some reason I was expecting more, probably because I’d read a lot of raves about it. \n\nFrankly, I don’t get it. It’s not even a particularly good rendition of jasmine and coconut, so I must conclude that the raves were for a different version than the one I have. It stays pretty much linear for a few hours, after which some musk develops along with the jasmine-coconut mix. To me, this was a big disappointment.', 'Bluemarinejosephine11/26/13 03:28The sun on your bronzed skin, the tiare flowers in your hair and the carefree, summer mood in your heart; plus, a fragrance to embrace all these in its scent and will revive your beautiful summer memories every time you wear it. This is what the “Bronze Goddess” seems to aspire to be and, to an extent, might actually succeed (for some).\n\nBefore I proceed with a review of the ‘Bronze Goddess” by Estee Lauder I have to admit that I am not a fan of the Estee Lauder fragrances but, I am by no means biased. To me, most of the Estee Lauder fragrances have a beautiful, elegant, fresh and discrete feel which is all very nice and they are ideal if you are stuck in the elevator with a few of your colleagues on the way to the office. Yet, that’s all they are; nice, fresh scents. There is no “va va voom” factor; that element that makes the fragrance (and you) unforgettable.\n\nAnd, boy, do I like “va va voom”!\n\nHaving said that, the “Bronze Goddess” is one more fragrance that falls into this pleasant yet somewhat indifferent category of perfumes.\n\nMy initial reaction to the fragrance is “hmm… too much alcohol”, it evaporates quickly though. The fragrance opens up with strong mandarin, orange and bergamot notes that are easily detectable and quickly weaken to give room to an oily ylang ylang note to develop.\n\nYlang Ylang is not of my favorite notes; quite the contrary. It feels oily, dump and artificial (somewhat like a lighter version of Castrol car battery oil).\n\nAccording to the fragrance’s pyramid, there is no ylang ylang note so, I suspect that it is the combination or amber and myhrr that gave me this impression. This oily ylang ylang resembling note stayed on my wrist for a good one hour (while I was wondering “where is the creamy, coconut smell?”\n\nAfter this hour, the note weakens and the fragrance develops its full potential transforming into a pleasant, clean, caramel, flower scent. I cannot feel the coconut at all and neither can I feel the jasmine and it does not feel creamy or oily. It is moderately sweet, moderately fresh, moderately warm; and it is very discrete. \n\nIt is actually so discrete that it is undetectable, I cannot even feel it there unless I persistently smell my wrist.\n\nDuring the next hour, it is completely gone so, I have to replenish by spraying again.\n\nAll in all, what the “Bronze Goddess” gives is a pleasant scent but only at the last hour of its overall 3 hour duration. It is not a scent that I would classify as distasteful or unpleasant. Nevertheless, I would not recommend it because the longevity is poor and you can enjoy the actual development of the scent only for about an hour before it completely fades away.\n\nThe bottle is cute, colorful, sparkly and feminine but, that is not a good enough reason to buy a fragrance.\n\nIn my view, this purchase won’t disappoint but, it may not be the fragrance that I would consider as a priority to purchase it again. (In fact, personally, I won’t).\n\nEnjoy the perfume quest!', ""mirrorghost07/30/16 22:28tried a bit of my mom's to see what it is like! in the beginning i get a strong coconut and maybe a soft musk, during the dry down i sense some subtle tropical florals and a sheer musk, but mostly this is coconut on me. i'd say it's a nice beachy summer scent. very uplifting. it's on the sweet side.""]"

Not beachy or summery enough","['Sboss07/29/23 02:21Stunning fragrance, the neroli in here isn’t screechy, sharp or nasty as in cleaning product type. It’s a lovely rendition of the neroli blossom! South of France summer vibes :))\n\nTo amp up the sweetness a bit, I combined it with Molinard’s Vanille, and it was just…. WOW!', 'aspirina07/28/23 10:41Sweet and fresh neroli scent, soft and feminine. Somehow it reminds me of a diluted fresher version of Oriana and LDBS. Maybe is just me, I have not seen any other review comparing these scents to Bronze Goddess Azur. \nInterestingly, I also got Ansaam gold by Lattafa who is compared to Oriana and LDBS, and it just keeps reminding me of BGA.', ""AnnaMaria030706/27/23 20:32This is a nice citrus neroli scent, perfect for a casual summer day. Longevity and sillage are really lacking though. After an hour it's a skin scent. Not worth it."", 'emaltic06/01/23 17:17I hope estee lauder would come out with more citrusy versions of bronze goddess. this perfume is bright, citrusy but sweet. well blended. perfect for the summer.', ""HannahRosesAreRed06/01/23 12:45This and the OG Bronze Goddess were blind buys for me. I liked Bronze Goddess, with its appealing, sunny coconut accords, but it left me slightly wanting. I was hoping its flanker would bring something new to the table, which it did. There's a very distinct cool, herbaceous note that dominates Azur, setting it apart from the OG Bronze Goddess, almost like fresh mint, despite mint not being listed in any of the notes. I believe this is how the fig note manifests on my skin, especially in combination with the very cold-smelling marine notes. The salt accord is subtle, the white floral notes of neroli and orange blossom add slight sweetness but aren't dominating. The coconut note reads more like coconut water–fresh and cool–as opposed to warm and bright coconut milk. Overall, this makes Bronze Goddess Azur one of the most pleasant and refreshing fragrances for the dog days of summer–but might be too cool to wear for any other season. \n\nHowever, Bronze Goddess Azur has one crippling Achilles Heel, shared with the OG–its longevity. It lasts maybe two hours on my skin, especially on my skin in the blistering SoCal heat. This sadly defeats the purpose of this otherwise lovely, well-blended and cool, fresh fragrance. I don't think I will be purchasing it again, but I am happy to have bought it–it's a good reach after a shower or a day near the pool, or for those moments when I need a good, fresh pick-me-up in the middle of the day. A safe blind buy, but sadly no staying power."", ""gretta05/01/23 19:49This was a total blind buy for me and it is absolutely stunning. I am head over heals in love with this.\n\nIt's salty like the sea, coconut (fresh coconut water - NOT coconut flavor), white floral, so refreshing, with a slight suntan lotion, which i love. To me this smells so clean, as i associate pool days with being clean. This is such a love for me!"", 'LMBelvi02/12/23 21:34I enjoyed sampling this for sure though I probably wouldn’t buy it. What it has going for it:\nReally well blended. Nothing overpowering. I can sometimes hate neroli and coconut can go really, well, Nuts. Neither is true here and the citrus is easy going. I have always liked the concept of a marine scent but so many haven’t worked for me. But the salt and sea notes here are polite. \nBiggest problem is that the longevity is poor and the fading happens in about an hour—it becomes very non descript. I might try a different flanker but am done with this one.', 'saho9302/12/23 13:41I like BG EDP better. I get too much cedar in Azur. It reminds me of Aerin Cedar Violet, which is not my favorite. Better than CV, but Azur is just ok for me.', ""KevinTheCarrot01/02/23 10:42This was a blind buy, but I tested Nuit in Boots and I saw this one online. \n\nIt really is such a beautiful scent and has a really nice edgy in the winter breeze, especially with the salty sea notes. Longevity is long, I kept smelling it on myself 5 or 6 hours after I sprayed it. The notes play out differently in the cold weather and it takes on a new life, because the coconut isn't as strong smelling. \n\nThe scent throughout doesn't really transform on me, but in the winter I get the salty sea, neroli and the orange blossom. I do also get a bit of musky orange. In the warmer weather, the coconut and musk smell a lot more prominent, but I don't smell as much neroli. \n\nSillage is more intimate in the summer and more moderate in the winter."", 'churinl05/04/22 13:35A new favorite for the summer. There\'s a good reason why there are so many Tom Ford fragrances listed in the Reminds Me Of section. It\'s that good! I\'m sure that his influence and a similar fragrance he created for Estee Lauder must have had some influence, though he was long gone by the time this came out. I love neroli in the spring and summer, and appreciate that the coconut doesn\'t overwhelm everything else. It just adds a slight creaminess along with the smell hovering in the background. I can also detect the fig note, which is very luscious. It adds ""something"" to the composition - I can\'t quite put my finger on it, but I think it would completely alter the scent if it was absent, even though it\'s certainly not a dominant note.\nI think it\'s a very sophisticated summer scent, and I like it much more than the Eau Fraiche Skinscent, which is very good. But this is a love, and when I use a perfume primer, I get about 5 hours longevity with moderate sillage. Given my husband\'s sensitive nose, I\'m sure he would say more than moderate! \nAs much as I love many of TF\'s summer perfumes, purchasing this instead of, say, Neroli Portofino is not a compromise at all. It\'s just that good!', ""Tessa0305/04/22 00:16I just purchased this and have not worn it yet - it's not warm enough where I live... but I will layer this with Go Naked perfume oil to make this last longer. They share a lot of the same notes. This one surprised me by how sweet and beautiful it is. I was expecting a fresher aquatic scent but it's more sweet/floral than I expected. Will update review when I've had the chance to wear it properly!"", ""singlehandedbeauty05/03/22 08:30Bronze Goddess Azur smells just like the color of the bottle. It's the most refreshing tropical scent I own. In the opening, I get fig, salt, and neroli with slightly bitter citrus. The bitterness is fleeting and the fragrance gains a nuanced sweetness from the coconut and orange blossom. Yes, it's super light and airy, but that's precisely what I love about it. It's the feeling you'd have if you were sitting in a garden at a resort on the Mediterranean coast, wearing a luxurious suncream under the warm sun, enjoying a cool, gentle breeze. Perfect for summer. I'd buy a backup bottle if it lasted more than a few hours.\n\nEdit: This has now become a summer staple. I wear it alone when I want to feel uplifted or layer it with Tom Ford Eau de Soleil Blanc when I want to be transported on a Mediterranean holiday. They are a magical combo that boosts the longevity of both perfumes."", 'Zethre04/02/22 07:20Similar to the original Bronze Goddess but with a turquoise blue note on top with a slight saltiness that reflects the sea. Coconut and sone flowers beneath it.

I bought it not long after it was released, there was maybe 1 YouTube video review at this point. So it may as well have been a blind buy for me. I have never smelled TF Neroli Portofino, but others have likened this to it. And for a fraction of the price.\nIf you think this is anything like the original BG it is not. It is all citrus to my nose. I see coconut listed in the notes but I don't detect any. Instead it is an extremely fresh scent which has no sweetness. Smelling it from the bottle does it no favours. You need to wear this on your skin in the high heat for this to do its thing.\nModerate sillage - i can still get wafts of this throughout the day and others can smell it in a closer proximity, but it doesn't really project.\nFor an EDT I think this is good.\nClose your eyes and you may think you were on the Amalfi Coast 🍋"", 'EstherR08/06/21 04:33Exactly Tom Ford Neroli Portefino just less strong since its Edt.

I get the fig note definitely.', 'fkt.julia07/11/21 02:53A beautiful citrusy neroli. I really enjoy it, a true summer scent. My only complaint is that it has little staying power, becomes a skin scent after about an hour or two. Maybe not worth the full price, an okay buy if you can get it on discount.', 'lucidvisi0n06/26/21 07:01I thought I wrote a review on this a long time ago but I guess not. I just thought I\'d put my two cents in for those who might be interested in this if they like the Bronze Goddess line --- It is nothing like that. I believe it is the only perfume I ever returned, I really disliked it that much. If I don\'t like a fragrance initially (whether sample, decant, or blind buy FB) I usually hold on to it though because my tastes evolve. This though, I couldn\'t see myself ever liking. I honestly after about a year can\'t remember exactly what it smelled like... But I would say, public restroom? But I know I gave it several tries. Each time I thought, I can\'t go out like this, it\'s embarrassing. And I scrubbed it off. \n\nNow maybe it does work for some people, judging by the reviews. And I am a die hard Bronze Goddess Eau Fraiche fan with backup bottles. Maybe it\'s ""skin chemistry,"" or something else. But the takeaway here is, at least learn from my experience and if you want to try it, buy it from somewhere you can return. Or try to sample first. Hope this helps someone on the fence!', ""Amalfi77706/23/21 14:28Bronze Godess Azur is summer in a bottle. The sea breeze and the freshness you need in a hot summer day or night!

There is nothing beachy about it, nothing festive or summery. I will stick with EL Bronze Goddess. I don't even understand how this is in the same line of fragrances. Big no for me.

To me this is very firmly a summer scent only - I agree with summersunshine that it needs a sunny hot day to really shine - but boy it really does! Not sweet but fresh, lightly aquatic, hint of sun lotion, it’s soft rather than sharp and leaves me sniffing my wrist. My only gripe is that it needs a heavy hand - I wish they would release this in EDP form. But maybe it would be TOO heavy then - it’s gentle sillage is part of the reason it works well in heat I guess.

Don\'t blind buy this based on other BGs you have smelled!\n\nI initially disliked this in the bottle. I first smelled it on a cool, rainy day (thanks British summer) and found it sharp and unpleasant. It was slightly better on my skin but still just kind of ""meh"". The citrus had an unpleasant bite, almost like a cleaning product.\n\nHowever I kept coming back to it (such a pretty bottle!!). But DAMN! this fragrance in the summer!! Wearing this on a warm (30C) day, its so much nicer. Its much better rounded and really develops nicely. On my skin, I mostly get the neroli, bergamot and marine/salty notes; the other citrus and coconut are there but more subtle. (Although that sharpness is still present in the opening--luckily on me this only lasts a couple minutes.)\n\nIts very, very summery, and was made for warm weather. This will be a vacation scent, as its rarely warm enough in the UK to wear it! Or I\'ll just have to turn my heating way up and pretend I\'m on vacation while wearing this. \n\nLongevity is very poor on me, lasts about 2 hours.

However its such a nice smell (and I was able to pick this up cheap) that I will keep it and douse myself in it liberally.', ""bodnerrachel07/02/20 14:30USE EXTREME CAUTION BEFORE BUYING. Very weak and not long-lasting. Very faint EDT. If you're expecting a powerful coconutty Bronze Goddess with an added whiff of the sea, it's not. It's a different experience altogether.

Don\'t blind buy this based on other BGs you have smelled!\n\nI initially disliked this in the bottle. I first smelled it on a cool, rainy day (thanks British summer) and found it sharp and unpleasant. It was slightly better on my skin but still just kind of ""meh"". The citrus had an unpleasant bite, almost like a cleaning product.\n\nHowever I kept coming back to it (such a pretty bottle!!). But DAMN! this fragrance in the summer!! Wearing this on a warm (30C) day, its so much nicer. Its much better rounded and really develops nicely. On my skin, I mostly get the neroli, bergamot and marine/salty notes; the other citrus and coconut are there but more subtle. (Although that sharpness is still present in the opening--luckily on me this only lasts a couple minutes.)\n\nIts very, very summery, and was made for warm weather. This will be a vacation scent, as its rarely warm enough in the UK to wear it! Or I\'ll just have to turn my heating way up and pretend I\'m on vacation while wearing this. \n\nLongevity is very poor on me, lasts about 2 hours. Projection is also weak; it sits very, very close to my skin.

There is nothing beachy about it, nothing festive or summery. I will stick with EL Bronze Goddess. I don't even understand how this is in the same line of fragrances. Big no for me. And I really wanted to try it and love it. Pluses were that it lasted a long time and it is unisex."", 'lucidvisi0n06/26/21 07:01I thought I wrote a review on this a long time ago but I guess not. I just thought I\'d put my two cents in for those who might be interested in this if they like the Bronze Goddess line --- It is nothing like that. I believe it is the only perfume I ever returned, I really disliked it that much. If I don\'t like a fragrance initially (whether sample, decant, or blind buy FB) I usually hold on to it though because my tastes evolve. This though, I couldn\'t see myself ever liking. I honestly after about a year can\'t remember exactly what it smelled like... But I would say, public restroom? But I know I gave it several tries. Each time I thought, I can\'t go out like this, it\'s embarrassing. And I scrubbed it off. \n\nNow maybe it does work for some people, judging by the reviews. And I am a die hard Bronze Goddess Eau Fraiche fan with backup bottles. Maybe it\'s ""skin chemistry,"" or something else. But the takeaway here is, at least learn from my experience and if you want to try it, buy it from somewhere you can return. Or try to sample first. Hope this helps someone on the fence!']"

Vote for Ingredients","['DemonHead02/17/19 16:04In the last few hours, Ive read a small handful of reviews (in fact all I could find online) of Chanel No. 46. Several tout this rare scent as somewhat similar to Chanel No.5, but after an hour or so passing this under my nose; I find it is in fact more dissimilar than it is similar. No.46 was Coco\'s perfume that celebrated the end of the war and was launched the same year as its name might suggest. Whilst one might imagine a bright and optimistic perfume to commemorate a newfound hope and liberty, No.46 in fact retains some of the austerity of the suffering years... it feels mature and considered and pregnant with rumination. Its flight boasts a bright citrus/evergreen prickle which charms the receptors, before veering away into a rich, floral heart steeped in ylang, jasmine and rose. This dense nucleus flits between floral and slightly plummy, and calls to mind Roudnitska\'s post-WW2 masterstroke ""Diorama"" (1949) with its clipped refinement and grown-up sophistication. A husky orris/musk base presses up from below lifting tendrils of sandalwood and vanilla with it. No.46 stands alone in the Chanel stable as it does not call to mind any other release (except perhaps the sublime Chanel unicorn ""Ivoire""). It resides in an olfactory register of wistfulness and scattered shadows; stylistically, something akin to Guerlain\'s ""Vol de Nuit"". A solemn and restrained perfume whose life was cut short at a time of renewed hope and optimism, there is no wonder No.46 was never a hit; but like most beautiful works of art, greater clarity often comes when you put a bit of distance between yourself and it. \nNo.46 is utterly sublime', ""superbesque02/05/17 16:13Thank you so much MuirinS for giving such a perfectly beautiful description of my FAVOURITE perfume!!!!! \nIt is so beautiful, mysterious and definitely haunting.....alluring.....that's what I LOVE about it.

I get the Chanel 5 cologne vibe as the animalics are present in both. To say this is vintage 5 with leather isnt too far off the mark. Where it shines is the creamy woody drydown. It wears about arm length and it lasts close to 24hrs on my skin. This is the kind of excellence that makes you sell half of your collection and wear only this. It may be too much for summer. Its going to make your bank account scream. Tell it to shut up and put it in your collection. Just magnificent.', ""LQR2802/19/23 13:53My Nana wore this--so I knew I had to get it at some point--but, alas, it smells like Saddle Soap on me!!

I also want to stamp my feet like a petulant child until I get my hands on the edp.', 'Callista2506/04/21 18:21Cuir de Russie edp is a powdery floral suede. The parfum is a true leather softened by a touch of lovely iris and abstract florals.

It smells to me of leather boots and birch trees, and russian aristocrats from Tolstoy, particularly Pierre from War and Peace. For me a winter fragrance for a holiday in a log cabin in the forest. It also mskes me think of 1920's nightclubs and gives me hope that after this time of Covid that everything will come back to life again as it did after the spanish flu of 1918. Perhaps we'll have our own version of the roaring twenties to which this fragrance belongs"", 'perfume.library01/21/21 06:01Cuir de Russie is truly a sumptuous leather fragrance. Opening with Chanel’s signature aldehydes and bouquet of rose, jasmine and ylang-ylang. There is a hint of citrus freshness in the opening before the fragrance exhibits its animalic, spicy, woody green facets. In the dry down the smokey birch tar and tobacco is prominent but never overpowering because of the sweetness of the white and yellow florals settling into a powdery leather which is a refined and soft leather, ever so seamless and warm. I enjoy its sultry almost erotic dry down which is much more enjoyable in the vintage formula but respectably close in the reformulation.', ""Jack_Hunter10/01/20 08:40I purchased this as I loved the Edp and it is a beauty in it's own right but there are differences. The extrait is drier, more smoky, less floral and is more unisex. It also smells more vivid like you are smelling something in high definition.\n\nIn the first hour as it melds with your skin chemistry you can smell the most gorgeous vivid dry jasmine note. I have to it to say it's more prominent in the extrait than the Edp. Then slowly the buttery Ylang Ylang with the touch of Iris makes it's presence known. It's low key at first where in the Edp it just dominates everything.\n\nAs time passes there is a interplay between the jasmine and the buttery Ylang Ylang with the touch of Iris. Until the jasmine fades more and this starts to take over. At this point the aldehydes come into play in quite a big way. It gives the composition a sparkling champagne like feel. \n\nAs we get closer to the basenotes the scent starts to become leathery, not suede and clean like the Edp but more of a dirty leather. But it is quite discreet and never overwhelms the scent as a whole.\n\nAs the fragrance is a pure parfum oil it does stay very close to you. Within I say half a arms length but it does have a distinct presence and is long lasting. But very subtle!\n\nAll in all a very beautiful scent best for special/intimate occasions or for when you want to be self indulgent."", ""1guy1dog3cats09/17/20 14:32About a year ago, I offered my thoughts on the current Cuir de Russie parfum.

And, well...\n\nOH.\nMY.\nGOD.\n\nIs there such a thing as a HOLIEST GRAIL? Because this is it. So much more emphasis on that smoky leather note. In contrast to my 2018 parfum, where the leather is softened, the leather here is foregrounded and rawer (though still suavely elegant to the nth, Chanel-th degree). The current parfum is suggestively sensual. The vintage is savagely sexy. The current, absolutely perfect; the vintage, exponentially perfect-er. And quite potent too!\n\nI swoon, Chanel. I swoon."", 'matty6408/05/20 09:00This is absolutely breathtaking. The price was a bit high but then when you dab it on with the glass stopper you’re transported to a Russian tannery.

Oh yeah, the dry down is classic Chanel.', '1guy1dog3cats10/19/19 08:08To put it simply, Chanel’s Cuir de Russie is transcendent. Become its vessel. It smells vintage, and it transports us to the past. But not to a sugar-coated, nostalgic version of the past—rather the reality of the past, to the eternal joys and struggles and messiness of being human. A skanky, smoky leather alludes to sexuality and lust; the ylang ylang and jasmine, to comfort and love; the aldehydes, to hope. Overall, it’s beautiful and sophisticated, but very grounding. Wearing Cuir de Russie feels like tapping into what it’s meant to be human for time immemorial.\n\nFor me, Cuir de Russie was a destination. At the beginning of my perfume journey, I didn’t understand its appeal. But after sampling hundreds of others, dabbling in different scent genres, I came back to it anew, and it felt like arriving home. I not only “get” it now, but I also feel incomplete without it. I will always have a bottle, and if I had to whittle down my collection to a single scent, this would be it.\n\nCuir de Russie, a forever masterpiece and my forever companion.', 'Florista10/01/19 19:00I am on a Cuir De Russie kick and won’t rest until I have the perfect formulation in hand. This one was a disappointment for me because it plays down that leathery, cigar smokey base in favor of a more serene, balanced composition. It’s a lovely, softly powdery (atleast on my skin) floral leather, very Chanel scent that stays close and lasts all day but it’s not what I fell in love with about Cuir De Russie so it’s a pass for me. I must stress that it’s still quite good and I still consider it a marvel of perfumer skill and excellent taste. I just miss that drydown of some of the other incarnations.', 'Noddygoestotoyland09/24/19 04:56My obsession with Cuir de Russie forbids me to waste my time on the EDP, as it already was the case relating to any more recent EDT version. While existing EDP being Chanel’s Cuir de Russie saddest face to day, one needs to declare war, just from the start. \nTherefore, only the Parfum format is to be considered. A vintage bottle even more so, undoubtedly. (I also own a half-full 200ml EDT from the 90’s, but this I don’t dare to use anymore, keeping it for a VERY rainy day I guess) \nIf I would ever have to choose one perfume alone for the rest of my life, this would be it. Objectively for what it is, and subjectively for how long I have had it in my days; from the times it was sold only at Rue Cambon 31, and there was no internet to beat the system!\nFor me Cuir de Russie is Chanel 5 horse-riding, and wearing its boots. \nAs much as leather notes are probably my favourite from all olfactory schemes, and for this reason any leather fragrance tends to win my interest, and likely some degree of sympathy… Chanel’s Cuir is the masterpiece and the masterplan of the entire clutch. Probably because here the leather note is so truthful in all its materiality BUT then also transcends it in its heart? That same heart beating inside Chanel 5 – its may rose and its jasmine – transforms the leather note and elevates it, taming it, giving it a complexity I have never felt elsewhere as “leather”. All notes borough from Chanel 5, counterintuitively as to make it resembling one another, affirm their difference. We can sense they are family, very close even, yet they are separate individuals and will have different lives and destiny. \nAt times I hesitate which from the two – as only these two are on the table – is my all-time favourite perfume. Most times think that Cuir de Russie wins, not because of any objectivity but merely for how much more personal, unknown, unspoken, it has walked beside me in life.', 'SnowStorm11111/20/18 11:12So often we are trying to materialize memories in scents with desire to keep fleeting moments with us forever. Cuir de Russie is one of those scents-to-moments for me: when my parents were young, summers were endless and life was easy and happy without efforts of the adulthood. \nMy father used to take few days long hunting trips every fall, and I missed him so much, that when he’d return, I’d hug him tightly and wouldn’t let go for hours. He had that special smell of leather hunting gear, fields, his pipe tobacco (loose Cuban tobacco called “Neptune”), game and aftershave. May not sound appealing, but when I smelled Cuir De Russie for the first time – it was it! Well, richer and with the touch or sophistication, but it was that very leather with tobacco and those pre-harvest fields. I don’t get any roses or vanilla, a bit of ylang – yes. Cuir de Russie is not easy to wear, even though my perfume is 15 years old and more rounded that current incarnations.

Lily of the valley? rose?) but here we go: heavy balsamic birch tar, vanillic tobacco, dark warm resinous incense... dried laurel leaves and oregano. what an experience... it is intense like knize ten, and it does remind me a lot of knize ten.\nI have to say that the leather notes are quite different from the les exclusifs edt and edp. they are not as sparkling and shimmering, i guess it's heavily aged.

Objectively for what it is, and subjectively for how long I have had it in my days; from the times it was sold only at Rue Cambon 31, and there was no internet to beat the system!\nFor me Cuir de Russie is Chanel 5 horse-riding, and wearing its boots. \nAs much as leather notes are probably my favourite from all olfactory schemes, and for this reason any leather fragrance tends to win my interest, and likely some degree of sympathy… Chanel’s Cuir is the masterpiece and the masterplan of the entire clutch. Probably because here the leather note is so truthful in all its materiality BUT then also transcends it in its heart? That same heart beating inside Chanel 5 – its may rose and its jasmine – transforms the leather note and elevates it, taming it, giving it a complexity I have never felt elsewhere as “leather”. All notes borough from Chanel 5, counterintuitively as to make it resembling one another, affirm their difference. We can sense they are family, very close even, yet they are separate individuals and will have different lives and destiny. \nAt times I hesitate which from the two – as only these two are on the table – is my all-time favourite perfume. Most times think that Cuir de Russie wins, not because of any objectivity but merely for how much more personal, unknown, unspoken, it has walked beside me in life.', ""Jack_Hunter10/01/20 08:40I purchased this as I loved the Edp and it is a beauty in it's own right but there are differences. The extrait is drier, more smoky, less floral and is more unisex. It also smells more vivid like you are smelling something in high definition.\n\nIn the first hour as it melds with your skin chemistry you can smell the most gorgeous vivid dry jasmine note. I have to it to say it's more prominent in the extrait than the Edp. Then slowly the buttery Ylang Ylang with the touch of Iris makes it's presence known. It's low key at first where in the Edp it just dominates everything.\n\nAs time passes there is a interplay between the jasmine and the buttery Ylang Ylang with the touch of Iris. Until the jasmine fades more and this starts to take over. At this point the aldehydes come into play in quite a big way. It gives the composition a sparkling champagne like feel. \n\nAs we get closer to the basenotes the scent starts to become leathery, not suede and clean like the Edp but more of a dirty leather. But it is quite discreet and never overwhelms the scent as a whole.\n\nAs the fragrance is a pure parfum oil it does stay very close to you. Within I say half a arms length but it does have a distinct presence and is long lasting. But very subtle!\n\nAll in all a very beautiful scent best for special/intimate occasions or for when you want to be self indulgent."", 'Callista2506/04/21 18:21Cuir de Russie edp is a powdery floral suede. The parfum is a true leather softened by a touch of lovely iris and abstract florals. It feels masculine, whereas the edp was unisex/feminine leaning. \n\nI far prefer the parfum to the edp in this case, the parfum being more distinct, stronger, and utter perfection. The edp just being lovely.']"

Allure Sensuelle was launched in 2005. The nose behind this fragrance is Jacques Polge. Top notes are Patchouli, Pink Pepper, Peach, Mandarin Orange and Bergamot; middle notes are Turkish Rose, Bulgarian Rose, Iris, Jasmine and Dried Fruits; base notes are Patchouli, Vanilla, Spices, Sandalwood, Vetiver, Labdanum, Lavender and Amber. Allure Sensuelle has preserved its unique and playful fickleness with dazzling citrus, fruity and floral notes, and magnificent wooden accords. Resemblance is there, yet the fragrance has become more mysterious and shady. It has not become heavier, but unlike the dazzling brightness and joyful sunny character of the classic Allure, Allure Sensuelle is warmer, its powdery (iris) and oriental notes are accentuated. Its sweet notes (candied fruits) are not obtruding, but hidden in sensual spices and frankincense.

The top notes contain bergamot, mandarin and pink pepper. The heart is composed of jasmine, rose, iris, candied fruits and vetiver followed by the base notes of French vanilla, amber, patchouli and frankincense. The perfume was created in 2005 by Jacques Polge. Its face is charming actress Anna Mouglailis.

I have friends who smell lovely in the edp of Sensuelle and the original but on my skin they don't smell as great. With reference to Sensuelle edt, it doesn't have that musky heaviness that seems to bother me in the edp - actually I would say that this kind of note is similar to the note in Allure edp, it is difficult to describe and as I normally like a bit of depth to my perfumes it is unusual but the freshness the edt brings to both really lightens it up. The Sensuelle edt still has the same DNA as the edp but is much lighter and fresher. Definitely prefer this to the edp for me anyway."", 'polkadot2710/09/17 05:38It is nice. A lot of Chanel fragrances have that old vintage (now commonly referred to as Grandma smell). The old vintage vibe is not as strong and overpowering in this one. It is soft and demure. It is 100% a skin scent. This perfume is just nice- I expected more in terms of longevity and projection considering it is Chanel. It would make for a safe gift for women 21 years plus. Not worth the high price tag though. CocoMadamoiselle remains my favorite Chanel.', ""LondonJean07/05/17 06:02Just a footnote; Allure Sensuelle EDT is not discontinued at all, as a few states here. It's all over the internet. Chanel even has it on their own website. This fragrance is and will forever be my signature. Pure love."", ""iamoir04/17/17 02:35Drydown: a smoky note, a peppery note and a blood-like note, all mixed in a very sensual way. Yes, I know this sounds a bit scary, but this is how I hear the notes personally, and after three long days of testing it...yep, I can't seem to change opinion. It's that disturbed and pretty. \n\nYou have a spicy peppery citrusy opening and a patchouli that develops right away. This is hands down the best iteration of patchouli that Chanel has ever made, better than the EDP, better and different than Coco Mademoiselle and Coco Noir. Basically it is a peppery,herbal, spicy patchouli. That gets smoky after some time because of the amber and the labdanum.\n\nDefinitely sharper than the EDP, and the vanilla here is non existent; no sweetness, thank God. Something winey too. Doesn't need to be jealous of the EDP's longevity and sillage. \n\nIt's so weird. I like it. Does it compete with my favorite Tom Ford Patchouli? No, but it's totally worth having as well."", ""hyperfluff02/17/17 23:37With Chanels, I'm always more partial to the EdTs, it's no different with Allure Sensuelle. I have a tiny bit left over from my 7 year old bottle. I haven't seen the EDT in department stores these days, which is a shame as I really enjoy this. The EDT is similar to EDP, it's just as sensual, but it's lighter, more earthy and dry, less rose in this version...the focus is more on the woods, vanilla, amber and soft spices, the fruits and florals here are subdued, dry and cozy. The EDP is more feminine and 'formal', the EDT is more comfortable, younger and can be worn by men, so it leans unisex. Something for confident, sensual women, perfect for the boardroom, the bedroom and everything in between. Day to night scent great for all seasons, it's as versatile as it's predecessor Allure (edt). If you are looking for a clean, warm patchouli with some understated sexiness, this is it. Good longevity with moderate sillage. I love the dryness of this scent. It brings to mind another 'unisex-leaning' sweet, earthy scent I love, Elixir des Merveilles...this one is classier and more 'sensual' though."", ""polly golightly10/21/16 10:00a differenza dell'edp, qui l'inizio è decisamente floreale e l'evoluzione meno complessa. il fondo restituisce un effetto più soave, meno pungente e radicale ma anche meno caratteristico. siamo sempre su territori speziati di pepe e resinosi di patchouli, ma c'è una certa morbidezza nel fondo di matita, che l'edp non ha. bello."", ""Martine7406/14/16 12:00I think Chanel and me just don't like each other very much. N matter how hard I try (and God knows I did), all perfums fall flat on me, even the wonderful Coco Mademoissele. \n\nSame with this one: I get a blast of chaos (rotten fruit? near dead flowers?), which lasts for an hour (so no distinctive tops, nor middles) and then: nothing but a powdery chemical-floral something which lasts for ever.\n\nClearly not for me."", ""Jmalone8411/27/15 14:51So mine smells different than the ones currently available to test in store. Not sure if the fresher ones are a different formula, or if mine has aged considerably. Perhaps a combination of both. The EDTs in the store are very different from the EDP. They are very light, sillage and longevity is unimpressive, and they definitely smell more 'fresh' than anything else. My EDT is darker in colour (I suspect it is on the turn), and is more similar to the EDP except not quite as potent. I actually prefer mine with a bit of age on it, have had all sorts of compliments and it lasts for ages. The review down there about the 'perfect patchouli' was right. I have come to appreciate both the EDP & EDT equally. EDT can be worn during the day and EDP for night. (If you're a hardcore fan like me). It is certainly a unique smell. There is what I can only describe as an ozonic element to it. Alluring and sensual indeed.

In combination with medicinal pathchouli and a classic bouquet of flowers, this makes for a very aromatic and rather dense-powdery composition. It is a rather mature scent yet it has a bright element from a signature touch of glittering citrus. \nThe EDT I have does not come as very ambery of vanillic - on me it is a semi opaque dry oriental-earthy scent with a perfumey-powdery dry down and a lightly echoing citrus. \nSleek and versatile.']"

This is a new fragrance. Chance Eau Fraiche Eau de Parfum was launched in 2023. The nose behind this fragrance is Olivier Polge. Top notes are Citron and Aldehydes; middle note is Jasmine; base notes are Teak Wood and Amber. CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE charmed the world with its joyous, lively, and sparkling scent. Now, CHANEL presents a new, dazzling and elegant interpretation of it. A new chance is within reach.
2002: CHANEL unveils CHANCE, a gleeful and optimistic floral fragrance creation. A name redolent of success and achievement. “Chance is a way of being”, said Gabrielle Chanel. It is no coincidence; it must be created, honed, sought out. It is the product of effort and passion. Four interpretations of this now-iconic scent emerged, including CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Toilette, a floral-sparkling fragrance with a modern, sophisticated, and decidedly light trail that features notes of jasmine and zesty citron paired with a teak wood accord. An invigorating composition with charming optimism.
2023: CHANEL reinterprets CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Toilette, creating a version that combines the density of an Eau de Parfum with the brightness of the Eau de Toilette. For this unique composition, CHANEL Perfumer-Creator Olivier Polge amplified the intensity without overpowering its freshness—a challenge he met with great success. CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Parfum has the same spontaneous, lively nature as the Eau de Toilette, but leaves behind a more intense trail. Rather than merely adjust the concentration, the perfumer composed something completely new, a fragrance in its own right. The citron accord has become exhilarating without losing its original juiciness; the jasmine is richer and more intense; and the teak wood accord reveals a more ambery facet, giving it a certain elegance.
OLIVIER POLGE CHANEL IN-HOUSE PERFUMER-CREATOR 
What was the creative process behind CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Parfum?
It involved making subtle changes in order to amplify the sensations provided by the Eau de Toilette. The idea was to go to extremes, to push the fresh notes even further, through citrus, and to add density with the base notes, ambery notes, for more vibration. The challenge with this was to increase its intensity, bring out the base notes, and add depth, all while maintaining its fresh quality.
Is this Eau de Parfum a radical departure from the spirit of the Eau de Toilette? 
They have the same fresh, colorful scent profile, with jasmine being the common thread that connects them. This new version is more textured and ambery than the Eau de Toilette. To achieve that, intensity has been brought to every layer of the composition (top, heart, base).

How would you describe the difference between CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Toilette and Eau de Parfum? 
The Eau de Parfum is a fresh, woody scent that opens with a burst of zest that is even more invigorating and exhilarating than before, accentuated by a hint of aldehydes. In this variation, the floral heart of jasmine is richer and adds a luminous, full-bodied quality. The teak wood accord and its intensified ambery notes add richness and depth for a more present trail.
CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Parfum is available in sizes of 50ml and 100m starting August 2023.

Much stronger than the edt. Smells classy and smooth. Not my cup of tea, but if you like woody citrus scents, it’s worth trying.', 'Maya lilac10/09/23 09:37Chanel Chance Eau Fraiche EDP is a very easy, breezy type of scent. \n\nNot that it smells identical to Mandarin Basilic or Eau Givree but it’s in the same vein. A very fresh, citrusy, clean, soapy, woody, innocent and inoffensive type of scent. Perfectly suited for wearing it in 40 Celsius degrees and above.\n\nIt smells natural and realistic but understated. Luckily, I don’t get aldehydes in here. Just citron, jasmine and teak wood. \n\nDare I say, it’s a more feminine version of Terre d’Hermes Eau Givree. Which I personally find to be unisex. Same notes combined and same execution. Chanel Chance Eau Fraiche EDP is somewhere in the middle the two scents mentioned above. Mandarin Basilic is sweeter and a more complex citrus and Eau Givree is a tad spicier.\n\nIt’s a DNA that I personally love but it’s overpriced. Chanel prices for this so called EDP is too high because it lacks performance, not intense enough like an true EDP should be for nearly 170€. \n\nBut it’s Chanel, so we are paying for the brand’s name…', 'DrRosie10/08/23 16:04After trying this a Macys, I had to purchase it and the limited body cream for it. Wearing the two together layered with the Coco Mademoiselle body oil creates a phenomenal combo.', 'Rose11210/07/23 23:11Eau Fraiche EDP is very similar to the EDT, with the biggest difference for me being that the base notes are much more pronounced. The teak wood notes really come through, and I would say lasts a bit longer as well. You still get that fresh, citrusy open as the EDT, but the EDP smells more woodsy overall. \n\nI’ve had this bottle for about a week now, and have been wearing it a good amount. This feels like a perfume you can’t really overdo, as it’s just a very inoffensive and clean fragrance. Personally, I’ve been doing about 6 sprays and that feels just right!\n\nHonestly, I think this could very easily be worn by men. It doesn’t strike me as particularly girly. This is very much in the category of unisex for me, as I think anyone could wear this. For the men out there, I’d say give this one a try over the EDT (though, you could wear that one as well!).', ""katie02kat09/28/23 07:56To me it is very similar to edt. It's just more floral, I love the edt and I liked this version too why not"", ""Kuty2209/27/23 11:59I've been looking for a perfume that smells like this for years 😆\nIn 2017 I absolutely fell in love with Dove's shower gel - nourishing secrets invigorating ritual with avocado 🥑 oil and calendula extract -\nAnd this scent reminds me exactly of it\nI'm so happy 😊 it smells invigorating\nBrilliant"", 'ION09/27/23 05:32This is a very logical release. It is close to the original - a true edp version of ""Chance Eau Fraiche"" edt. \nAn Americanised, more straightforward and unisex interpretation If you like (even though I don\'t see many men going to the Chanel counter and buying it for themselves). A bit more oriental also (I get hints of a very subtle Coco Mademoiselle patchouli accord).\nDon\'t get too excited however, there is nothing extraordinary here and if you already have the edt, there is no rush going out and buying this one. \nThe performance doesn\'t seem to be any better either - I was sprayed many times on my cotton t-shirt with this one and 6 hours later, it was hardly there. I\'ll have to give it another chance of course 😊 , but I get the feeling that the edt lasts more on me (certainly the older batches).\n""Chance Eau Fraiche"" edp, is not a bad perfume by any means and I think that it serves its purpose quite well, even without the poetry its edt sibling has.', 'junimo09/25/23 13:38Very fresh with a warm dry down because of the amber. Only slight woodiness on my skin. Aldehydes are prominent.\n\nBeautiful, but smells like so many others. I would only buy a FB of this if I used up of all my other freshies and just wanted to stick to one. \n\nIf you’re looking for something a lot lighter and brighter, try Versace Versense.', 'Clairexoxo09/24/23 04:10I personally prefer the original that I find more unisex/feminine leaning. I love the original’s interpretation of the lemon note and the hints of creamy musk.\n\nThis one is more masculine leaning. The teak wood is very prominent which is another difference from the OG.', 'floralfragrance09/24/23 02:47I appreciate the effort. Good perfume, certainly Chanel. The original was a certain work, with seamless combination of masculine with fresh feminine. I would always get compliments. This one, is not as smooth and there is a clash between the masculine and the attemted warmth. There is sharp that shouldn’t be there. The original one was crisp and fresh, this one is good in theory but not as great in execution. Chanel has been disappointing me with all the latest releases, including the Gabrielle line. Older creations, Allure, Beige, even Mademoiselle for instance were all super well blended and seamless. I’m afraid the time of good perfumes are long gone, so sad', ""imegaphone09/23/23 09:43This is more unisex leaning masculine than the OG when tested side by side. I prefer the OG. It also has a strong moss note to my nose even though it's not listed here. I tested it from an offical Chanel sample, wore it to work and I enjoyed the first 3 hours, but later it started smelling too masculine for me. So I won't be getting a full bottle, I have the OG and if I were to repurchase it would be the og concentration because it's lighter, airier and to me unisex bur leaning feminine."", 'huda_jubail09/23/23 01:58Imagine Chanel house comes out with a \nPURPLE CHANCE !\nSmells of fresh cut LILACS 💜💜💜 \n\nI love Lilac, why there’s no Chanel fragrance with lilacs in it?\n\nActually we need more colors in Chance line \n\nAlso imagine if it comes out with a light blue or a turquoise Chance. 🤩\n\nSigh', ""katerina.fel09/22/23 08:441,5mL sample\n\nI was sniffing some Chanels at Sephora when an employee approached me with a free sample of Chance EF EDP (since when does that happen?). I always skipped the Chance lineup because I'm not a freshie or a citrus lover. I quite like it. Chanel does not disappoint, love their consistency in quality. \n\nClean girl, blue shirt, well hydrated, office job but fancy. \n\nI'm unsure if I want to buy it or not. I feel like whenever I get a bad bad reaction to my perfume from strangers it's when it's very citrusy. This might be the first citrus dominant perfume that I actually enjoy. So simple and so elegant. Also, I don't smell any jasmine. Can't comment on longevity yet. \nIt makes me want to explore the entire Chance line. I'll be back!!!"", 'huda_jubail09/21/23 00:39Just bought it yesterday and I’m in love! It’s almost how I expected it to smell like, I really like the casuality of the EDT but THIS EDP is way much nicer and it’s so calming but refreshing at the same time, polished, elegant and polite. It’s so easy to wear anywhere at anytime but I would consider it a formal day time fragrance very suitable for business meetings and for attorneys ect… \n10/10\nExcellent creation', ""orpheusdream09/20/23 05:35Oh wow. I'm certainly not in the target group for this perfume, but I love the style of Olivier Polge.\n\nVery modern, almost futuristic. Quite simplistic, but very 'effective'. To the point. What a beauty. \n\nLove it."", ""serenitynoow09/19/23 22:03The opening on this one leans masculine to my nose, citrusy and woody, although I'm not getting the 'sharpness' other users have mentioned. I'm not the biggest fan of the first 2-3 hours of this on my skin, but 8 hours later I was getting wafts of something that smelled really familiar, I couldn't put my finger on it. Upon sniffing my wrist, this smells almost identical to Ralph Lauren's Cool from 2004 which is extremely nostalgic for me."", 'Addict2Perfume09/18/23 22:57As someone who has cherished Eau Fraiche EDT for many years I was so excited for an EDP release of this beautiful fragrance! The EDP has been reduced to a simple scent with a stronger base; a woody-sweet citrus with a sprinkling of jasmine. The EDT has more diversity to notes, the flowers sing, and the citrus sparkles on the skin. The EDP will be great for layering and the amber-woody dry-down makes this wearable in the cooler months for me. I have no regrets, Chanel is always pure class - you will definitely smell good!', ""brt09/17/23 07:56I stopped by the Ulta Chanel counter yesterday and gave this one a spritz. My nose was very pleased that Mr. Polge has really warmed it up by amplifying the jasmine in it. In the past, I'd found the edt version too masculine leaning for my taste, but I love this warmer, more feminine edition. The miracle is that it hasn't lost any of its crisp freshness. This one might go on my want list."", 'Michylaka09/14/23 18:02I knew I had to skin test this EDP. It sounded unique. It also sounded a little complicated. I love my EDT of Eau Fraiche. I call it my perfect Florida ""Summer"" scent. And it is. It is calming to me and gathers compliments everywhere I go. So this was a must try. \n\nWhen I first tested this EDP ay my local Dilliards Chanel counter I liked the pompous Citron with the Wood and Aldehydes but I was not sure it was a love. Or if I had to have it. I kept on shopping letting it develop. I was trying on clothes and kept smelling a gorgeous soapy, woody Jasmine. It reminded of something. I could not place it. Then it hit me. L\'Occitane...the shop. \n\nYes indeed. That was it. \n\nThis scent is very French. Very refined. But more reminscent of the South of France. Where the original Bouillabaisse comes from. Where Crudite is a normal day long snack. Where the sky is bright blue and the aqua ocean water twinkles as the Sun hits it as it moves about. And where Cote du Rhone Rose is the drink of choice for its refreshment. \n\nI went back to the Chanel counter and bought the big bottle. I love it. It is a little masculine but on my skin as it develops I do get some moderate Jasmine too. I did layer it with my Caswell Massey Jasmine to give it a bit more of a floral kick and that was wonderful. Definitely skin test. And let it develop of course.', 'LadyIva09/10/23 06:14I was certain that I would love this new EDP - ouch, what a blunder! The problem is that the opening is too sharp and piercing, with citron and aldehydes, and I’m certain that there’s neroli lurking around, although it’s not listed. Later, when it settles, it’s kinda nice, but I can’t get over that unpleasant opening. Not a safe blind buy by any means.', 'baristacrat1109/09/23 00:15I just got this one- I absolutely was OBSESSED with the opening- I literally kept spraying it on my skin, clothes, hair, over and over- because… the opening !! One of the most satisfying smelling perfumes at first spray to me because the combo of the cedarish/crisp/woodiness… it just was reminiscent of when I used to open my mothers old cedar chest- with a burst of freshness and almost a chypre type wave behind it -that smell very unisex at first- but upon the dry down, everything just comes together and smells well balanced, leaning more feminine. I would get your hands on a sample and let this grow on you like it did me before blind buying. I’m now hooked and got myself a bottle. Mainly because not only did I think it rocks, but, I got lots of compliments - AND, from young women In their early 20’s at a restaurant and gas station!', 'leatherorrisviolet09/07/23 18:14Bleu de Chanel Pour Lui', 'Ki.marie09/07/23 14:00I finally smelt this since my Ulta finally have Chanel fragrances. This smells like a green flavored freeze pop with a mix of some woods. It’s far from basic, and I do not recommend blind buying .', 'pursueliving09/06/23 19:25This EDP is just what I was waiting for! This is stronger than the EDT but still has the ""eau fraiche"" smell that makes it decidedly Chanel and most certainly Chance Eau Fraiche. It\'s delicious and strong and it kind of ""pops"" with scent. It lasts a good six hours, sillage is beyond arm\'s length when first sprayed but settles into a comfortable scent bubble that I could smell for hours. Very similar to the EDT only it lasts longer and smells as if it\'s on steroids, but the scent\'s the same or so close I couldn\'t tell the difference. I\'m very glad Chanel finally came out with the EDP.', 'Ulusia09/03/23 03:34If I had to pick one fragrance for spring and summer it would be this new edp. In the edt there was smth that bothered me - maybe my skin reaction, here it is not plus it has great longevity. Finaly I found beautiful citrusy fragrance that is rounded by other ingredients with decent longevity. Bravo.', 'violeteme09/02/23 08:07Beautiful! Very nostalgic, very similar to the EDT version, but I find this a bit purer, the citron and teak wood notes are better felt, more intense. Great longevity, gorgeous projection. Classy and refreshing.', 'melanie mother or foxes09/01/23 13:20Tested this in store today. I own and love the edt version and this is a stronger more vamped up version. This is lovely, I may have to invest. One spray on my wrist lasted a good 5 hours and I got wafts of it when I moved my arm. 👍🥰', 'RoseJam202008/30/23 09:17Irish spring vibes for real. Too masculine . Jasmine too faint.', 'alternateu08/29/23 06:11I bought it within the hour of trying it on my skin……….\nThis is SO gorgeous, it has that sexy, vaguely woody and earthy base on paper (for me personally those notes come out first) with a strong Chance EDP DNA. On skin, at first spray, there’s a burst of citrus which quickly melts into waxy, fatty aldehydes. If you’re not an aldehyde lover (I absolutely am), you might not like this fragrance, especially since the rest of Chance tends to be patchouli, pepper, plus varying amounts of sweetened fruits across the flankers.\n\nChance EDP - the pepper in the beginning gives me headaches some days, but I absolutely LOVE the patchouli and it dries down SO sexy and musky on skin\nChance EDT - I prefer it at first spray to the Chance EDP - fresher and less cloying, but the dry down is disappointing and turns flat. There’s no sexy musky patchouli and the pineapple doesn’t stay. \nEau Tendre is not for me - too sweet. The EDT is way too girly and sweet for me, the EDP is nice on paper but still a little too feminine for me (I’m female but it’s somehow a little too girly)\nEau Vive - didn’t stand out for some reason \nEau Fraiche EDT - I must confess I didn’t try this on skin, only from the scent sample in the store, but the EDT smells a little crisper and more “freshie-type” perfume.\n\nI would suggest to macerate the new bottles a little bit.\nIn the store, absolutely killer longevity and projection both on skin and paper - I could smell it walking around a busy, heavily fragranced shopping centre. My new bottle smells the same, but has less projection and only lasts about 4 to 5 hours.', 'Casbag1108/26/23 21:54Better than edt… had the edt and loved it but this is better… dry down is smoother the only difference I can detect …still perfectly unisex …something about the edt dry down annoyed me… this lasts longer too… I was needing to replace my edt but of course great timing bought the new one instead… happy with my purchase', ""nuitbleunoire08/26/23 10:22I experience this fragrance today and to me, it's a feminine version of Bleu de Chanel. Very fresh and sporty in this typical blue fashion, it's very nice and very Chanel!"", 'RhettB2708/25/23 12:05The original Chance Fraiche is superior imho more crisp, airy, and the citron/lemon combo hitting just right with the light aquatic floral facets. The aldehydes on this EdP definitely come out during wear adding a more classic and green facet similar to No5, but overall I just enjoy the composition of the original Fraiche much more.', 'fourleafedrover808/25/23 11:20Hmmm. This one has me in a bind. As a freshie addict I want to love it, and at first I found it fabulous, bright and fruity-green meets vintage perfumery but there’s something so powdery and aldehydic in deep dry down that makes me want to scrub it off. There’s a little too much laundry, a little too much of that classic shampoo scent that often reads apple. I wouldn’t personally purchase this at this price but I’d definitely love it as a gift.', 'Miss.Tara08/22/23 12:53I was just going to buy Les Eaux Paris - Paris, but this has the same addictive layer within, minus the patchouli AND lasts longer. I’ve enjoyed the whole Chance line over the decades, but this really is something special. Someone here compared it to a more refined version of CK One, and I’d agree. Though, Fraiche EDP has a touch of floral.\nAs far as comparing this to the EDT, imo, the EDP is smoother, less green, and more sparkling.', 'maen08/21/23 06:35I feel very lucky, I just tried Chance Eau Fraiche Eau de Parfum!!, well, for start it\'s something magical, very very Chanel, from my point of view it has a slight touch citric of course (same as the edt) , but later it doesn\'t work bitter, it goes more floral. Is said that it is more woody, but on me it is creamy sensual, it maintains edt dna always, majestic jasmine with a slide of kind orange and a little warm amber... I like it way better, updated and with more personality! Long-lasting and notorious, while the first one remained me more “fresh morning and sporty"", now it is more daring and assertive, great edition!', 'npadua1308/18/23 18:10This is so fresh in a sexy and sophisticated way. I love the opening. I liked the toilette but was too weak so really happy they came out with a stronger formulation. I would wear this most of the year, maybe not deep winter but it’s very nice for super hot summer. I think it’s very nice classy wear to the office sent but husband loves it too.', 'beauu08/18/23 15:52A really beautiful scent, love this and the original one. Expensive but worth it, definitely a day scent and get such summer vibes from it!', ""qianqian08/16/23 18:46a much more refined and lasting version of CK One.

First of all, it's hard to source, because anything can affect the final quality of the oil, including climate and soil. Secondly, processing of iris is very time and labor-consuming process, which lasts a couple of years. However, Chanel never made a single compromise about the quality of her (their) perfumes.

Chanel N°5 (Vintage) was launched in 1921. The nose behind this fragrance is Ernest Beaux. Top notes are Aldehydes, Ylang-Ylang, Neroli, Lemon and Bergamot; middle notes are Rose, Iris, Jasmine, Orris Root and Lily-of-the-Valley; base notes are Civet, Amber, Sandalwood, Musk, Vanilla, Oakmoss, Patchouli and Vetiver. The famous Chanel N°5 is a symbol of good taste and is currently one of the best selling perfumes in the world. Coco Chanel asked the perfume designer Ernest Beaux to create a perfume “which smells like a woman“. Chanel N°5 is a very complex fragrance which does not allow any of the fragrant components to be isolated out of the composition, what was exactly a request of the great Chanel – the perfume should not smell like a rose, or a lily of the valley, but as a composition.
The perfume became famous thanks to many celebrities who wore it, among which Marilyn Monroe. Chanel N°5 is often connected to her name because during an interview in 1954 she said that in bed she wore only ‘some drops of Chanel N°5\'. That statement became a superb advertising slogan and a reason for millions of women around the world to choose this perfume.
Ernest Beaux created two series of perfume samples numbered 1-5 and 20-24 and asked Coco Chanel to choose one of them. Madame Chanel chose the sample no. 5 and thus the perfume got its name. Superstitious, Chanel presented her new perfume on the fifth day of the fifth month of 1921.
Working on creation of this perfume, Ernest Beaux created and for the first time used the synthetic component – aldehydes. In his formula the aldehydes are accompanied by fragrances of rose and jasmine. The fragrance of aldehydes is pure and fresh, reminds of the odor of clean linen just brought in the house form the fresh frosty air. It is said that the famous creator drew his inspiration for creation of this fragrance from one of his visits to the Arctic Circle and the smell of water in midnight. The unique smell of frozen lakes and rivers fascinated him so much that he decided to replicate it in his creation.
Chanel N°5 is the first perfume in the floral-aldehyde group and the first by the quantity of aldehydes in its composition (another legend says that the Ernest Beaux\'s assistant overdosed the aldehydes in the composition by mistake). The top notes are composed of aldehydes, bergamot, lemon, neroli and ylang-ylang, the heart of jasmine, rose, lily of the valley and iris, while the base is created of vetiver, sandalwood, vanilla, amber and patchouli.
The first Chanel N°5 was captured in a simple rectangular bottle with the top which resembled Place Vendome in Paris. The first bottle was designed by Chanel herself and represents her classical principle – less is more.

Powdery and aldehydic smell","['rhanson47503/28/23 00:17I bought this fragrance years ago before it was discontinued. I still have a small portion tucked away for my wedding one day. That’s how beautiful it is. \n\nI always wanted to love the original Chanel no 5 ever since I heard that’s what Marlyn Monroe wore but it never agreed with me. This is a soapy, warm, comforting rendition of Chanel no 5. To this day it’s one of the most beautiful perfumes I’ve ever smelled. There’s no sharpness it’s just epitomizes sensuality! Love it', 'Sapienta09/28/22 08:32I adore all variants of chanel 5. This one is my least favourite, although its also magnificent. Very low on vanilla, the sweetest of them all. Soapy, intimate and feminine.', ""violeteme03/18/22 09:20The scent is angelic, clean and voluptuous at once. It reminds me of Bois des Iles a little bit. It's soft, powdery and sweet. Rose, yang-ylang and neroli, clean sweet jasmine make a beautiful elixir. Colour of the perfume represents it well, it is feminine and delicate. It doesn't create an enormous aura around it, it is polite and stays like it. +"", 'Ensconce-in-Bloom05/05/21 18:24Chanel N°5 Elixir Sensuel Chanel is an office friendly fragrance. For lovers of Chanel No. 5, this would be one to have and hold. The scent stays close to the skin and invites admirers to come closer. Very romantic. A lady like perfume. I have an almost full bottle and am willing to part with it as I am downsizing my collection. Message me.', 'Lulushka03/25/20 17:48Over the years, I’ve worn and owned every iteration of Chanel No.\n5 that I could get my hands on. I started with the sometimes maligned EdP (I didn’t know—it was the 80s! I was 16. There was no internet. Forget the excuses—I just loved it, and I still do). During a purist phase, I wore the parfum and nothing else. Then I discovered the joys of French-manufactured No. 5, with its richer and more floral profile I’ve also dabbled across the spectrum of vintage offerings, because even with bruised aldehydes or other age-induced flaws, No. 5 always comes through in the drydown with one of life’s great sandalwood experiences. Currently, I’m back to the classic EdT (made in France), but I also have a bottle of the Elixir, and that’s what I’ve been reaching for in recent months.\n\nThe Elixir formulation conveys all the complexity of No. 5, but the sharp, tingly edges of the aldehydes are rounded and smoothed over, so the effect feels less crystalline, and more like a soft twinkle. It wouldn’t be No. 5 without that sparkle, but it’s softer, and perhaps kinder to noses that struggle with aldehydes. There isn’t much of an opening, and the Elixir doesn’t evolve like traditional perfume, but a silicon-based formula doesn’t have the same volatility, so it’s pretty much the same from start to finish. I also don’t get much powdery musk from the Elixir, so if you like No, 5 L’Eau’s cleaner finish, but want less of its emphatic citrus and more of the original’s golden jasmine/ylang/santal heart, you’ll really enjoy wearing this. It wears close to the skin; its relatively gentle projection and slightly less aggressive profile are perfect for office wear, although it’s fresh and undemanding enough for casual and every day wear—and it’s still No. 5, unmistakeably so, so it’s never out of place with cleavage and stilettos. (I also love it on the men who are intrepid enough to pull it off; male chemistry tends to emphasize its woody notes, and I like the aura of mystery conveyed by a conventionally feminine scent. But maybe i’m just perverse).\n\nChanel has always made exquisite ancillary goodies (No. 5 body powder, with its giant old fashioned puff, makes me feel like Norma Shearer getting dressed for a night at the Copa with Irving, even when I’m just trying to recover from another day of Social Isolation and apocalyptic news (stress is the most significant factor in making or breaking your immune system, so a hot bath and a little pampering is more than just an indulgence. And don’t even get me started on their French-milled soaps—they’re a religious experience in themselves)), and the quality of materials in No. 5 Elixir is outstanding, even for a company with notoriously high standards. It melts into your skin with the same ease as the parfum.. The applicator is a simple dabber, so you can do a Marylin-style touch behind ears and on wrists, or you can smooth a little with your fingertips in the crook of your elbows (my personal favorite for scent application). The bottle feels sturdy, and its relatively compact size and tight seal make it ideal for keeping in a purse or gym bag, which adds an extra level of versatility to one of perfumery’s great all-rounders.\n\nChanel really knocked it out of the park with this one, so the question remains (as of 2020): what happened to Elixir, and why won’t they bring it back? I know that scarcity is part of perfumery’s grand illusion, but it would be a real treat if Chanel periodically put more Elixir on the market. The only downside I’ve found is that it doesn’t keep particularly well or age like traditional formulas do: 24 months is about as long as I’ve gotten from my bottles (I’m on number three, and this will be it for me); and toward the end of my first two, as the scent in my bottle began to fade, I added a little Eau Premiere to ensure that I got a consistent amount of scent per application. But each time I open a fresh bottle, it smells great, and each has lasted just as long after opening, so I haven’t noticed any quality issues, so long as I’ve kept them sealed.\n\nSilicon-based products like Elixir had a real moment in the perfume world about 10 or 15 years ago (does anyone remember Lovely Body Satin or whatever it was called? I loved that, too); it seems like those have given way to other ancillaries like hair perfume these days, which I can’t really get excited about. I would love to see more Elixir-type products come back on the market, and the astronomical prices you have to pay for the few remaining bottles of Elixir show that there’s plenty of demand, so I don’t know why Chanel doesn’t bring it back. If they do, sign me up; I can’t justify the aftermarket prices I’m seeing, so I’m going to enjoy wearing my last bottle of Elixir while I can. If the perfume goddesses and/or the powers that be at Chanel S.A. are reading this, please hear my prayers: I’ll gladly buy more—and would you please consider adding Coco and No 19’while you’re at it?', 'candieslove01/12/19 23:03My first chanel perfume, it smells good, i love the floral smell', ""Shwets06/21/18 05:53Im surprised i havent reviewed this!\n\nThe elixir version is one of my favourite versions and it reminds me of stronger No 5 L'Eau. What i love about the elixir is that it lacks the aldehydes that im sensitive to.\n\nThe scent is soft, soapy flowers and also reminds me of the No 5 body lotion. The problem with No 5 and its products, is that i tend to easily get a headache after wearing (L'Eau is an exception).\n\nIt is different to the regular EDP or EDT and the colour i'd associate these to, would be 'golden'. The elixir as appears in the picture reminds me of 'light pink'. Once, an SA mentioned that it goes straight to the dry down of the EDP, but i didnt find that happening on my skin.\n\nI used to own this twice (left one with someone and swapped the other). I do love this scent so much but its just too soft and as it remains so close to the skin it appears as non existent. I do like perfumes to have some presence. A stronger version i would say would be the hair mist. I had that too but the headache was the issue so gave it away. The body creme had the most sillage but for the same reason that went too - oh and that scent was closer to the long rectangle No 5 Eau Premiere. \n\nJust to get back to the point, the Sensuelle Elixir is beautiful but it wears like a light scented lotion so if you are after a perfume then this may not be one to hunt, but wonderful to wear at bedtime or if you dont mind your fragrances remaining private."", 'Carriewlin01/31/18 22:01So, it seems I’ve found my No. 5. Like many others, I’ve tried and failed to wear other versions, including multiple attempts with Eau Premiere, which I thought for a while would work for me. Not sure what prevents me from being able to wear No. 5. The sharpness? The sillage? Most have been too strong, and not quite scents that I’ve wanted to announce my presence when I walk into a room. Enter Elixir, the discontinued, hard-to-find, and (therefore) usually expensive Chanel No. 5. It smells enough like the rest of the family that people would likely recognize it as related to its sisters, but here’s why I love it. Uncapping the top to slide it along my wrist...something about the thoughtfulness it requires, the slowness, makes me appreciate it more than many other bottles in my collection. The design of the bottle demands that it be handled gently so as not to spill the contents, which makes for a more mindful application. The smell radiates just far enough for the person closest to detect it, but it isn’t wimpy. It wears kind of like an aura, or what I want to be my aura, anyways. It DOES smell sort of like a combination of No. 5 and Bois Des Isles, as mentioned by an earlier reviewer. \n\nHow much is a bottle of this worth? Well, I’ve paid a lot more for perfumes I didn’t like nearly as much. Seems these are going right now for anywhere between $100-200 on eBay. If I could get it from a reputable seller? I’d probably have been willing to go up to $120. Knowing what I’ve paid for others gives me a good gauge for comparison. For the gel formulation and stopper bottle alone, it differentiates itself from other fragrances. Buying this, your money is going in part to the experience of applying it. And it is memorable and lovely. I do think it’s worth it. In this era of busy-ness and wanting immediate gratification and having so little time to just be still, this perfume got me to slow down. I do recommend it.', ""camden-girl07/20/17 12:20I,m only just starting to get into Chanel no5.\nAnd I love every version.\nThis version needs time to settle down.

No. 5 in it's purest form is a floral musk as much as it is an aldehyde floral. This fragrance lacks the musk and that civet, and it is also missing the rose. I really do like the rose in both No. 5 Parfum and Cologne. Here its the ylang-ylang that becomes the star as it did in Eau Premiere. The iris and jasmine are also really standing out and the scent becomes powdery very quickly. It opens with less citrus and less aldehydes than the No. 5 everyone's used to. Sweeter, softer, easier to wear, younger, fresher, cleaner and dries down to sweet wood and a creamy amber. Really good not great, easy to wear No. 5 for someone who is beginning to get into Chanel fragrances and perfume itself."", 'Jernê Knowles02/11/16 15:49When I think nothing will surprise me, Chanel # 5 Elixir Sensuel Chanel crosses my path, and gives it to my face making me a passionate declared immediately by him. It is the dream of anyone who ever wanted to use the traditional Chanel # 5, but the bombastic aldehydes his predecessor never allowed him. This is a version of ""mademoiselle innocent"", the globally acclaimed Chanel # 5, only this one, the aldehydes were washed with water jug containing fresh flowers; nothing aggressive, all very tolerable and addictive it, a delight for warmth and also for spring. An alternative Excellency to feel well dressed (a) with the Chanel identity and their aldehydes, lilies and Jasmine dirty in warmer seasons, or even to go to the beach, why not ?! Has a light, clean footprint as its other versions even remotely can transpire, because they do not have it, in addition to the presence of an Iris said well velvety, firm and there on dewy background, giving that touch of makeup that refers to Finesa immediately. Do not expect this version an absurd silage, however, she lets a satisfactory perfuming golden style that appeals to those who use it and those who embrace it, too, is a scent that ends ambaradamente woody, but without losing the subtle touch to there recognized Chanel away by lovers of house! The consistency of its juice is thick, very strange, but it\'s nice when it touches the skin! 10 for Chanel # 5 Elixir Sensuel Chanel!\n\nWord of the day: satisfaction... (day 85)', ""Nomen01/24/16 04:42So this is the No 5, which could work for anyone, though its exclusivity is still guaranteed by the limited quantity produced and high price. It has that Chanel sleekness, the perfect blend, the class, but it is not nearly as intimidating as the real No 5. \nI used to be one of those, who could not get their way with the original, the most popular world's fragrance. It would have struck me as too loud, too dominant, too aggressive and old fashioned. Luckily, I was introduced to No 5 Premier, which is now one of my favorites. That's how I started giving a chance to the rest of the range. \nIf I do say so myself, that Elixir Sensuel is perfect in terms of being recognized as an absolutely lovable, pleasant scent, regardless of specific individual preferences. It makes a kind of paradox, though. If it wasn't so rare, I'd expect it to actually become the best seller today! I cannot imagine someone to go wrong buying it whether as a gift, or for their own pleasure. This is so soft, so delicate, so refined... one just cannot go wrong with it. It is like a cashmere scarf: it cannot offend anyone, nor send a wrong message. If it's gifted, that lucky person would recognize the generous, yet sophisticated gesture, and most probably enjoy it themselves. If it's for your own pleasure, you'd surely want to wear it often for that comfy feel and luxurious touch.\nDo not expect a huge aura, though. This is a discreet, sensual indeed, practically skin scent. For all the No 5 fans, Elixir Sensuel can perfectly compensate for your signature during relaxing, intimate moments, when a cloud of perfume is not attractive, nor appropriate. I'm speaking of those moments, when you want someone to be as close to you as possible, like cuddling with your baby, whether it's your child or lover."", ""woodlandwalk07/13/15 11:42I find this softer than Chanel 5 eau de parfum, less aldehydes.

The original No. 5 is beautiful but I find it heavy and I can't deal with civet. Chanel Elixir Sensuel is it's more modern yet equally stunning twin sister. This version will appeal to the 20 and up set (like myself), who appreciate classic fragrances but don't want to smell old fashioned. I really can't say enough about this beauty. This is gorgeous and everything I love about perfumery; intoxicating and emotionally stirring. I love classic florals with mild aldehydes and a touch of sweetness. Elixir Sensuel greatly satisfies this craving. My only issue is it's longevity; I wish it lasted longer. It's in gel form and it lasts about 4 hours on my skin which is heartbreaking. Usually lack of longevity is a deal breaker for me when choosing to buy a fragrance but with Elixir Sensuel I happily made an exception. Besides, reapplying just means that I get to experience this fragrance symphony all over again. This is too beautiful to pass up.

The body lotion has more sillage and a scent that lasts longer than the Elixir, but it has an additional ""product"" smell that reminds me of the Body Shop\'s Vitamin E products which were once purported to be ""unscented"" but never were to me! The Elixir smells more like a body product to me, rather than a perfume. It\'s pretty enough, but it\'s my least favourite incarnation. For one thing, I miss the boldness that intoxicates me in the EDP. \n\n(While Eau Premiere smells a little bit like the parfum, it is light and pretty with its sheer vanilla accord... verging on an what I might call an Eau Fraiche... I love the EDP and EDT; EDP is my favourite.)', 'bettybluebell06/10/13 11:05Elixir Sensuel is far closer to the original No5 than Eau Premiere. This version of No5 dries down to a slightly sharp warm amber, as opposed to a rich aldehydic floral of the original. While Eau Premiere is an identity to itself , I feel Elixir Sensuel is really just a slightly off center No5. Elixir Sensuel makes a wonderful base for any of the No5 fragrances, adding a warm background to any of the versions. On its own, I am not sure ES is worth the money as it has very light staying power and sillage. It make a nice indulgence if you are a big No5 fan, otherwise stick to the original or the vibrant and wonderful Eau Premiere.\n\n7/19/13 I have to admit after using Elixir Sensuel in conjunction with Eau Premiere, I started reaching for Elixir more and more.

Then I discovered the joys of French-manufactured No. 5, with its richer and more floral profile I’ve also dabbled across the spectrum of vintage offerings, because even with bruised aldehydes or other age-induced flaws, No. 5 always comes through in the drydown with one of life’s great sandalwood experiences. Currently, I’m back to the classic EdT (made in France), but I also have a bottle of the Elixir, and that’s what I’ve been reaching for in recent months.\n\nThe Elixir formulation conveys all the complexity of No. 5, but the sharp, tingly edges of the aldehydes are rounded and smoothed over, so the effect feels less crystalline, and more like a soft twinkle. It wouldn’t be No. 5 without that sparkle, but it’s softer, and perhaps kinder to noses that struggle with aldehydes. There isn’t much of an opening, and the Elixir doesn’t evolve like traditional perfume, but a silicon-based formula doesn’t have the same volatility, so it’s pretty much the same from start to finish. I also don’t get much powdery musk from the Elixir, so if you like No, 5 L’Eau’s cleaner finish, but want less of its emphatic citrus and more of the original’s golden jasmine/ylang/santal heart, you’ll really enjoy wearing this. It wears close to the skin; its relatively gentle projection and slightly less aggressive profile are perfect for office wear, although it’s fresh and undemanding enough for casual and every day wear—and it’s still No. 5, unmistakeably so, so it’s never out of place with cleavage and stilettos. (I also love it on the men who are intrepid enough to pull it off; male chemistry tends to emphasize its woody notes, and I like the aura of mystery conveyed by a conventionally feminine scent. But maybe i’m just perverse).\n\nChanel has always made exquisite ancillary goodies (No. 5 body powder, with its giant old fashioned puff, makes me feel like Norma Shearer getting dressed for a night at the Copa with Irving, even when I’m just trying to recover from another day of Social Isolation and apocalyptic news (stress is the most significant factor in making or breaking your immune system, so a hot bath and a little pampering is more than just an indulgence. And don’t even get me started on their French-milled soaps—they’re a religious experience in themselves)), and the quality of materials in No. 5 Elixir is outstanding, even for a company with notoriously high standards. It melts into your skin with the same ease as the parfum.. The applicator is a simple dabber, so you can do a Marylin-style touch behind ears and on wrists, or you can smooth a little with your fingertips in the crook of your elbows (my personal favorite for scent application). The bottle feels sturdy, and its relatively compact size and tight seal make it ideal for keeping in a purse or gym bag, which adds an extra level of versatility to one of perfumery’s great all-rounders.\n\nChanel really knocked it out of the park with this one, so the question remains (as of 2020): what happened to Elixir, and why won’t they bring it back? I know that scarcity is part of perfumery’s grand illusion, but it would be a real treat if Chanel periodically put more Elixir on the market. The only downside I’ve found is that it doesn’t keep particularly well or age like traditional formulas do: 24 months is about as long as I’ve gotten from my bottles (I’m on number three, and this will be it for me); and toward the end of my first two, as the scent in my bottle began to fade, I added a little Eau Premiere to ensure that I got a consistent amount of scent per application. But each time I open a fresh bottle, it smells great, and each has lasted just as long after opening, so I haven’t noticed any quality issues, so long as I’ve kept them sealed.\n\nSilicon-based products like Elixir had a real moment in the perfume world about 10 or 15 years ago (does anyone remember Lovely Body Satin or whatever it was called? I loved that, too); it seems like those have given way to other ancillaries like hair perfume these days, which I can’t really get excited about. I would love to see more Elixir-type products come back on the market, and the astronomical prices you have to pay for the few remaining bottles of Elixir show that there’s plenty of demand, so I don’t know why Chanel doesn’t bring it back. If they do, sign me up; I can’t justify the aftermarket prices I’m seeing, so I’m going to enjoy wearing my last bottle of Elixir while I can. If the perfume goddesses and/or the powers that be at Chanel S.A. are reading this, please hear my prayers: I’ll gladly buy more—and would you please consider adding Coco and No 19’while you’re at it?', 'cacraine04/29/12 19:03I was wearing this today to test it out and I was at first disappointed that the silage was so low. Out of the blue my 5 year old daughter kept coming around and sniffing me on my wrists and neck....I thought she would tell me it was stinky but she smiled and said ""you smell pretty mommy"". It is a fragrance that I am going to have to get used to because I am more used to all the fruity florals of today, but to my daughters un-biased nose it was beautiful. She told me it smelled like flowers...and all I could smell was powder and aldehydes. Her nose is obviously more refined than my own.', 'Chouli Galore01/17/11 09:55Ooohhhhhh, this smells soooo good! Pretty, lightly sweet, a smidgen powdery, petite fresh and lovely, an so very, very feminine. The previous reviews used some good adjectives to describe the Elixir Sensuel: Comforting, Luxurious, Stunning!\nWhen I bought this at the store I was ooh\'ing and awe\'ing so much that one sales woman accross the floor yelled over to me ""The Elixir is my favorite too!"" And the other sales woman who was waiting on me said ""YES! I love the Elixir too and so does my husband."" We were all happy ladies that day and enjoying ourselves.\nThis version is so much nicer than the spray version. If you want to like Chanel #5, then try the Elixir Sensuel and expand from there.', 'DresdenDoll09/12/11 06:56Between the original No.5, Eau Premiere and this, this one is definitely my favourite. The orris, musk and ylang ylang come out beautifully on my skin, with a hint of a mildly soapy jasmine, making it soft and creamy. This seems less like a typical Chanel to me, but I think this is because the aldehydes are so muted. I think this would be a very lovely and inoffensive day time scent.', 'Bandit04/10/15 13:39I don\'t know why ""Pentecostal Smell Good"" is telling all this stuff about fakes, tubing and ebay, because Elixir Sensuel is a dab bottle with a gel to liquidy stuff inside. I would bet, that the market for fake Elixir Sensuels is very little, so no money in producing fakes. I\'d say, if you buy a bottle on ebay, it\'s probably not a fake, although the inside might be tempered with. \n\nYou probably find fakes of No. 5 EdT and EdP in bigger bottles more easily than a real bottle, though.', ""camden-girl07/20/17 12:20I,m only just starting to get into Chanel no5.\nAnd I love every version.\nThis version needs time to settle down. I actually disliked it at first it almost was like a off smelling mess, hang in there as this becomes a soapy woody musk with such well blended flowers, hard to pick any out, more woody than say the edp.\nShe dries down to a lovely expensive french soap kinda smell, clean and perfect after a shower to wear cozily in bed. To me the parfum has more strong dusty lemon , where as this is more woody and much less lemony.\nVery romantic, in fact a few hours latter my wrist smelled very very sweet, and that sweeter side stayed gentle but constantly there till next day.\nConsidering I had not like the start I loved the mid and finish !\nI don't get much powder on me :( a note/s I love so I just dust with powder too lol in fact I mix all the no 5 perfumes / bath bits together mmmmm.\n\nMy hubby keeps saying it's just like Imperial leather soap, and what's all the fuss about ?\n( He says it whilst trying not to laugh as he likes to joke with me and knows I love no 5 )\nCoco must be turning in her grave at our conversations lol :)\nI decided not to poke him in the eye just yet as I had a feeling he would warm to this creamy deliciousness at some point, plus I knew he was joking...\n\n...Later on ,the same few hours into testing this, I was cuddled up to my man watching you tube when he said you smell beautiful ! \nSO there you go ! ! !\n\nFragrance 8/10\nSillage 5/10\nLasting power 6/10"", 'evesoho06/18/13 18:48If anyone else would just like to read a strict comparison: I think Elixir Sensual and the Chanel No 5 body lotion are similar - and both of them have too much of an astringent smell for me to want to wear them instead of the EDP or the EDT. The body lotion has more sillage and a scent that lasts longer than the Elixir, but it has an additional ""product"" smell that reminds me of the Body Shop\'s Vitamin E products which were once purported to be ""unscented"" but never were to me! The Elixir smells more like a body product to me, rather than a perfume. It\'s pretty enough, but it\'s my least favourite incarnation. For one thing, I miss the boldness that intoxicates me in the EDP. \n\n(While Eau Premiere smells a little bit like the parfum, it is light and pretty with its sheer vanilla accord... verging on an what I might call an Eau Fraiche... I love the EDP and EDT; EDP is my favourite.)', ""Shyn's Release01/04/10 09:50This is softer than the original much more wearable it is a gel fragrance that isn't sticky on the skin.But it doesn't interest me I guess No.5 isn't for me.""]"

This is not an injection of Hyaluronic Acid in the lips of N5.\n\nIt is the stripped version of it, but it carries its soul and, of course, the weight of its reputation.\n\nOlivier Polge plays here with the most ethereal concepts of what N5 is. The cleanness of aldehydes, the beautiful citruses, the flowers and a little of the sandalwood in the background.\n\nHe unmade it and counstructed it again, beautifully, keeping in mind a market, again, saturated with orientals and ouds and vanillas.

The smell of Burberry Summer (2010 edition) is synonymous with freshness. \n\nOverall Rating: 5 stars"", 'gypsy parfumista06/16/11 11:52I received a spray sample of this from Lana Lool (Thanks friend!) and though I love the 2009 version of Burberry Men Summer, this one is VERY similar. The only thing I can see (sniff) that is different about it is that it has no apple, and has dyer\'s greenweed added, which gives it a sharp slightly green vegetal edge.\n\nThis (on the first spray) is amazingly citric with the mandarin\'s slight sweetness and yuzu\'s bright juicy sparkliness. As the top notes evaporate, there is still a ""citrusy"" feel there; but it DOES get more green with mint, juniper and the greenweed. There is an odd sweetness lingering just behind the light (white) woodiness. The drydown ""sounds"" somewhat oriental, but to me it is just ever so slightly warm and smooth, and accents the top and heart in a clean and refreshing way, while not overpowering them . This is an excellent scent for hot and humid days, and would make any citrus and green lover very happy; and it is done in typical Burberry style. This scent is the olfactive equivalent of swimtrunks and a cool crisp white tank-top. Like a warm green summer wind, the sun on your face and your toes in the sand. Citrusy, aromatic and quite well-done, but I did not (and am not going to) run out and buy a bottle. I WILL, however, enjoy the sprayer sent to me this summer...and should I happen to see it in a discount store for a great price would buy it, as I love the whole Burberry line of perfumes.\n\nSillage: good\nLongevity: average\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nI think Burberry is thinking along the lines of ""if it isn\'t broken, then don\'t fix it"" and this is very nice and only slightly different (less fruity/more citric) than the last year\'s version. It is a lighter fresher alternative to Burberry Men: brighter and more ""summery""; but at the risk of sounding like a ""snob""...there are better summer scents out there. It does the ""job"" by keeping things fun and light though, while still managing to say SUMMER, and projects rather well!

I was instantly reminded of Dior Hommer 2013 but it’s not quite the same. I would say that this is more closer to dolce & gabanna light blue, and even then it’s not quite the same as that either. It’s like they were inspired from those scents but went a different direction. It sort of reminds me of a lemon meringues pie, but even that can’t describe this smell. Lemon and mint on the top, floral in the mids, and a nice amber/musk drydown. I ended up going back to where I bought this and purchased another one immediately. I’m so damn picky with my scents, and before I blind bought this, the reviews that I’ve read on here does not do this juice the justice it deserves. Which to be honest is perfectly fine for me, this flew under the radar, it just means more bottles for me that nobody else wants. This to me is as close to a 10 as it gets, and it would have gotten a 10 if it lasted just a tad longer. You get 4 hours and days if not a week if it’s on your clothes.

Decided to give it a couple more chances a short time later, and the next couple times I smelled a very light, fruity aquatic scent that lasted for about 3 hours or so. Well, last night I put some on right before settling down in front of the TV, and this time it was like the first time. Barely there! I would catch the faintest whisper if I turned my head a certain way, but it smelled very watery and not much like a perfume. Even that faint whisper was gone within an hour.

Orange is the most dominant note, being rather bitter and sour at times. My skin never works too well with citrus or fruits, so seeming that Burberry Summer 2011 is all about the fruity accords, on my skin it turns acidic.\n\nThe heart is nice but predictable with soapy freesia and delicate rose. The drydown isn't any more interesting with a rather bland blend of cedar and musk. The scent does become less harsh as the fragrance settles, however the underlying orange note lingers on. Not that I find orange an unpleasant note, it's just not something that easily agrees with my skin or my nose.\n\nI still prefer Burberry Summer 2009 which was much more pleasant and less generic.

This one is a light, green floral I ❤ for daytime casual wear. Perhaps a better spring/summer scent, it is a floral fragrance I'd wear year round, due to the abundance of woody aromas.

A friend gave this to me because she wasn't a fan, but I really quite like the subtle sweetness behind this, and the added woody notes. I find that although Burberry are not always at the top of my list of favourite perfumes, I always find their fragrances strange and compelling. The combination of orange and musk in this is pleasant, alongside the pomegranate. I don't find it as distinctive as a lot of other perfumes though, and as genny17 said it's a 'safe' scent that is nice but not overly memorable.

The cold, yuzu-filled opening surely reminded me of some candied fruit I used to eat back when I was a child - It was fragrant, citric and zesty. Then it settles readily to a warm, woodsy musk which sits close to the skin. Whenever I smell this it reminds me of a wooden boat full of lemons. Weird, yeah. And since I live in a tropical country, this lasts around 2-3 hours and pops out at random times when I thought it was gone.\n\nThis is a scent perfect for those days you just want to have a picnic or walk by a grove where the sun shines fully at you.

Stunning! The caraway and driftwood add some light spice and a beachy woody feel to this while the citruses are still detectable. The woody sweet drydown of cedar, musk and warm amber remind one of a summer evening: relaxing, smooth and luxurious.

It's just what I need for summer: a light but still present and unique enough fragrance that I can enjoy every day without actually smelling like a chemical fruit syrup. Surprisingly, I got plenty of compliments on it, same thing with the 2007 edition (someone said it smells tempting - bergamote and freesia, go figure:D)"", ""vertigo05/14/09 05:14I agree!\nVery tasty without being too sweet. Gentle and innocent, and in the same time - modern and urban.\nIn the beginning the fruits are on the floral base, then they become lighter and I can smell a really nice fruity juice with sparkling water :)\nThe base reminds me of L'Eau par Kenzo.\nReally makes me smile :)"", 'psychedelicious09/22/23 03:36This was my first real perfume as a teenager and I remember liking it so much I emptied the entire bottle in a year (probably also due to the fact that I didn’t know how to use perfumes at that age haha).

My boyfriend has the same opinion.', ""mandashell07/28/09 15:18Finally got to test this one and it really falls flat and is very bland. It smells like lemon and that is about it. Not sweet or woodsy or anything else. I can not make out any other specific notes. On the positive side it has really good sillage because the scent stayed on the top of my hand hours after I left the mall. It was still there after I washed my hands a couple of times.

Goddess was launched in 2023. The nose behind this fragrance is Amandine Clerc-Marie. Top notes are Vanilla, Lavender, Cacao and Ginger; middle note is Vanilla Caviar; base note is Vanilla Absolute. “Fragrance has always been a great love of mine, and I am fascinated with the power that scent can have and the way it can immediately transport you to a specific time and place in your life. Being allowed to become an ambassador for the new Burberry fragrance feels particularly special and personal.
To me, lionesses represent female unity and strength. They are confident and move together. Much like them, we stand on the shoulders of the women who came before us and those who bolster us throughout our own lives. To me, this image is a real source of empowerment.” - Emma Mackey, Burberry Beauty Ambassador
Burberry unveils the new Burberry Goddess Eau de Parfum, a unique aromatic fragrance for women. The launch is supported by a campaign featuring British-French actress and new ambassador for Burberry Beauty, Emma Mackey.
The campaign presents a story of self-discovery inspired by the collective strength and power of the pride of lionesses. Created with live footage of lionesses in their natural environment and the latest CGI technology, Burberry creates an imaginary world where Emma Mackey and the pride come together as one.
Embodying the spirit of the Burberry Goddess Eau de Parfum, Emma channels the strength of the pride, igniting the power within to discover her inner confidence and ascend the peak ahead of her. Echoing Shygirl in the overlaid vocals, ‘one of me, but I’m not the only one, we are many burning like the sun’, the lionesses represent the collective power of female strength and support and the fact that together, we can all discover our inner goddess and achieve the extraordinary.
A unique gourmand aromatic fragrance led by a powerful trio of distinct vanillas. Collected by hand, the beans dry in the sun for five to seven weeks. They are then stored in wooden boxes to mature and develop their sweet signature aroma.
“My initial goal for Burberry Goddess was to expand upon the common use of vanilla to deliver a new kind of rich olfactive experience. For this purpose, I used three distinct types of vanilla extraction. The first is a vanilla infusion, which provides the brightest, woody vanilla possible. Then I used Firgood™ , also known as vanilla caviar, for the first time in a fragrance. This innovative new ingredient adds a sweet, rich, and animalic vanilla. Lastly, vanilla absolute is darker and richer, enhancing the fragrance with a mysterious, milky aspect.""  - Amandine Clerc-Marie, Master Perfumer.
During the process of creating the perfect vanilla accord, the precious vanilla was wrapped with notes of bright Lavender Diva essence from Provence and earthy notes of cocoa and ginger roots, creating an aromatic balance to each vanilla.

Usually that 'i just got out of the shower' scent, goes away in a matter of minutes. Using this fragrance allows me to have that smell all day. It's great for the office or even as an everyday scent while running errands. \n\nI don't expect to get compliments with this perfume as it doesn't really smell like perfume to me. It just smells of fresh lien and a more intense version of how my skin would naturally smell after my morning routine. The name Body is perfect! This scent can also be used as a layering scent. I've used it with different types of body splashes and they all mesh well. \n\nThe packing of this fragrance is amazing. It's luxurious, classy, beautiful and chic. The downside to this fragrance is the price. I believe I paid $100 for a 3.4oz which is a little pricey for a perfume that doesn't demand attention and probably won't be complimented often.

Body Eau de Toilette was launched in 2012. The nose behind this fragrance is Michel Almairac. Top notes are Green Apple, Wormwood and Peach; middle notes are Rose, Tea and Sandalwood; base notes are Musk, Cashmere Wood, Vanilla and Amber.

Body Eau de Toilette is a fresh fruity fragrance that retains attractive original notes and offers sparkling new flavors such as green apple and tea. It opens with accords of green apple, peach and absinthe. Rose absolute and sandalwood are in the heart, typical of all Body compositions, this time enriched with tea aroma. The base retains its original structure; there are musk, cashmere, amber and vanilla.
Model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is the face of Body perfume line. The campaign is shot by Mario Testino.

I can detect apple and rose and tea(which is one of rare green notes that I enjoy) in a light musky,woody base. it's notes are well blended and I don't find it too rosey, or too fruity, or too musky or too woody or too green. it's a bit of each of these blending together creating a pleasant,springy scent which I find versatile,easy to wear and ageless .it's fresh and crisp but also warm and sunny. I don't find it too unique or interesting but who cares? there's no need for every perfume to be earth shattering.it's work place friendly and can make a safe gift choice. longevity and sillage wise it's not too strong but not bad for an edt.it's recognizable for people standing close to you without being overpowering to bother anyone \nمن رو یاد جیونچی آنجو دمون له سکرت ادوتویلت(اونی که زرد کمرنگه) میندازه بااین تفاوت که انگار اینجا بجای یاس، رز داریم. خوشبختانه من اون نت ورم وود رو حس نمیکنم. من سیب میگیرم و رز و چای تو یه زمینه ملایم چوبی،مشکی. بنظرم عطر دلپذیر و همه پسند و راحتیه. ملایم و فرش و تمیزه درعین حال یکم گرمای ملایم داره شبیه گرمای آفتاب اوایل بهار. عطر خاص یا پیچیده یا خیلی جالبی نیست اما برای محل کار خیلی مناسبه و گزینه امنیه واسه کادو و بنظر من از اون عطراست که محدودیت سنی نداره. از نظر پخش و موندگاری قوی نیست اما واسه ادوتویلت بودنش بد هم نیست. درحدی هست که دیگران هم اگه نزدیکتون باشن متوجهش میشن اما نه به شدتی که بتونه واسه کسی اذیت کننده بشه"", ""suzanne_ronald09/29/23 06:20Soft Peach-Chypre with Sweet Tea drydown...\nThis is another contemporary interpretation of a chypre from master perfumer Michel Almairac, along the lines of Gucci Rush (also by Michel Almairac), although these are different. Opens with a burst of soft, peach chypre and dries down to sweet tea and cashmere. In the first couple of minutes after the spray dries, I can the feel the fruity green-apple & peach accented by the bitter-green, herbal & aromatic tones of wormwood. Wormwood here reads a little like a greener oakmoss with a dash of incense to my nose. Already the rose & tea are swelling through. As it transitions to the heart the rose & tea move forward and sandalwood adds a woody sweetness. This all rests on a fluffy musk & Cashmere wood base with hints of amber-vanilla. Performance is well above average. \n\nContrast to Body by Burberry EDP:\nAlso composed by Michel Almairac, these are very similar, although the EDT is slightly less sweet, and the tannic component is more obviously a tea note. Both are well above average performance-wise.\n\nContrast to Body Tendre by Burberry:\nAlso composed by Michel Almairac, these are very similar, although Body Tendre is more rose forward. Both are well above average performance-wise.\n\nContrast to Gucci Rush Gucci:\nWhile these are very different scents. both are composed by Michel Almairac and there are some similarities with both being a peach chypre. Gucci Rush I get prominent Lily of the Valley & patchouli notes that aren't present in Body by Burberry EDT. Body by Burberry EDT outperforms current formulations of Gucci Rush for projection & sillage, but these are roughly equivalent for longevity. \n\nOverall: gorgeous soft peach-chypre with well above average performance that becomes beast mode when layered over its matching body lotion. It's a longtime love for me. Enjoy!"", 'Gemsense05/25/23 07:08Love this in warm spring weather!

It’s too musky and rosy for my liking. \n\nIt was difficult for me to pick between the two. I sampled them for several days because they are both lovely. \nHowever, I decided in EDT because it’s more me.', 'Gemsense10/23/21 14:17I like the edt and the edp but it took awhile for me to get used to the edp. I assumed the edp would be better but i was wrong. This one, the edt, is better to me because the rose stands out more in this than in the edp. The edp has a really strong wormwood smell that is only deepened by the peach and its not good right away because of that. The edt on the other hand has the apple which opens the door for the rose to step in and use the wormwood as a doormat, which suits this scent far better.\nthe depth of the edp is far more my style as it lingers thick around my body and i love that. Although the airy crisp rose is a stunner too in the edt as it dances around and envelops leaving a trail as well. Im glad to have both since i crave both quite often. They have actually replaced my beloved Spellbound which i never thought that could happen. Not cuz theyre similar scents but the essence of the fragrance is similar.', 'Vanilla violin03/22/21 22:31I have finally discovered the perfect light apple scent. Body EdT is my favourite of the Body line. The wormwood in Tender is so strong and bitter, it dominates the composition and makes it unwearable in warmer weather. The rose is more subdued than in the EdP, and the apple note it just right. Lovely!\nIt reminds me of the sadly discontinued Gucci Envy me.', 'UnearthlyApothecary02/01/21 07:54Very interesting...not as rich and intoxicating as Burberry Body Gold that I used to own. I don’t get much Rose at all. The synthetics dominate a slightly bitter green (wormwood/absinthe) apple. This reminds me of a fresher, airy, green version of Lacoste Pour Femne. The thick cashmere feel in the base is the same. And now that I think about it, Pour Femme had apple as well. If you are a fan of modern synthetics this is a really unique composition, I really love it, it wears pretty skin close but lasted a good 9 hours', 'valevaleria07/12/20 20:20I smell a refined Apple and flowers.

I used to almost not feel that I had it on after a couple of hours, but then after a full workingshift at the nursing home when I walked by a couple of coworkers, they told me I was smelling so good. Sweaty and all..! 🙂 So I guess this goes well with my skin, then. But since I did not feel it so much myself, I went buying the edp. But unfortunately it’s a bit too strong for my nose - the absinthe, I think. So next time I will stick to this lighter version after all - I just have to respray a little, if needed!!

They are quite similar, but being an EDT this doesn't last very long on my skin. A bit fruity, but not as much as you'd expect. It's fresh and woody, but soft and delicate. You can aid the silage and longevity by using along with Burberry's Body Milk, which smells absolutely divine. This fragrance makes me feel very feminine. The design of this bottle is absolutely gorgeous as well, Crystal-like with some define heft. The tall thin Body bottle is the perfect vessel to be held and easily sprayed.

A light sprinkling of woods and musk are not far behind and all of the notes are in harmony with each other. Eventually, the apple fades but tea, rose, a good amount of musk, and a light woodiness remains on the skin.\n\nThis is really like a “just out of the shower” skin scent. It’s aptly names “Body” and has become a staple in my perfume wardrobe. Great for everyday wear. Lasts about 5-6 hours on me that I can pick up faintly when I press my nose to my wrist, but there have been occasions that I was complimented long after. So maybe this lasts longer, but I just can’t smell it after a while. \n\nPeople, especially men, seem to love this on me as well as the EDP during the winter time. Trick is, don’t spray this too heavily. When they pick up a subtle hint of this fragrance, it seems to make them turn their head and wonder, “where is that beautiful scent coming from?” It doesn’t bash them over the head. It’s intriguing, a bit coy, and alluring. For that reason, it’s a bit mysterious.', 'Nicole f11/05/17 16:13This lasts well on my skin. I do not smell any fruit or florals, just a fresh, clean scent. Safe for work, school ect. Nothing special.', 'Beadvised08/16/17 05:07This is decent if you want to wear a basic fragrance that is normal. Seems the staying power is decent. Just a regular floral musky scent.', 'lmonch08/02/17 07:15I love this light scent. It is uplifting throughout the day. It smells intoxicating.', 'kaejuntun05/07/16 20:22Ahh yes... This is my favorite version of the Burberry Body line! The original was too heavy for me, but the EDT version strikes just the right pitch. It\'s an amped up clean skin scent on me - the apple is definitely there, but it\'s more tart than sweet, lending a crispness to the scent. Peach and rose are definitely prominent, just like the pyramid suggests. The original could definitely come across as a more ""mature"" scent, while I find the EDT much more versatile. The powder and woods are toned down, but still present in the dry down. Essentially, this Body smells like a combination of freshly washed skin, lotioned up, with some natural rosy muskiness. Clean and comfortable and elegant. Lovely and feminine. \n\nAnd BONUS! I am in love with the oil spray, and the EDT is much more similar to the oil than the original EDP is. A few squirts of the oil and one spritz of the perfume and the fragrance envelops me in a comfortable hug that hints at something more.. Just a touch more intimate than friendly, not quite sensual, but the chemistry\'s there. ;) <3', ""Lucyb279704/14/16 03:57I thought I remembered falling in love with this perfume after testing it last summer. However, regrettably, after buying a 35ml bottle online I discovered I must have been remembering a different Burberry fragerence as this is rather unpleasant on my skin, sort of tart and metallic but with a nauseating sweetness, my brother mentioned it smelt just like Turkish delight, and I agree! Fresh and fruity at first but as as it dries the main note I can smell the rose/Turkish delight. To me its a very cold fragerence, reminds me of cool glass, I suppose like roses in an elegent glass vase on a fresh spring day. I can see why others love this, its delicate and fresh but unfortunately just does not sit well on my skin. This is probably a long shot but does anyone in the UK want to arrange a swap (preferably for another fresh, fruity spring/summer fragerence, but I'm open to trying other things)?

The EDP lasts longer, but the fragrance is different. I am torn between whether I should repurchase or not.', 'charloppe08/24/15 04:38Oh my god, I can´t smell anything on my skin!? Literally nothing?

It is very light and pleasant. On first application it reminds me of canned lychees. Then it develops into a barely-there soft-musk scent with a perceptible woody tone. I have to put the back of my hand up to my nose to smell it after 2 hours or so; by then, there is the faintest hint of tobacco (might be the tea). I don't get any rose or apple tones. This is a keeper: a your-skin-only-better scent for sure. Funny, but the dry down of this reminds me of the considerably less expensive Cafe Cafe, albeit much more subtle.

Over the year my my taste hasn\'t changed, but I still hadn\'t found the ""one"". Recently with a lull period of not wearing any perfumes. I found Burberry Body. This perfume is me (today - described in detail within the scent). I love it. Powdery and woody smell, with musk and fruit scents, after a few hours the woody/powdery scent comes out more and the one important thing, is that my husband loves it on my skin. I love this smell.', 'Juliana607/20/13 06:26First seconds after spraying I feel some cool, refreshing, ""sparkling"", fruity champagne, then comes the sugar coated but still sour, mouthwatering apple followed by a nice rose bouquet. \nWhen it settles down, it becomes warm ( sandalwood, I think). It\'s a pity that I don\'t get all the base notes- no vanilla, no cashmere. It\'s musky and keeps some of the apple sourness, freshness.\nI imagine it on a young, modern woman wearing high heels and following the trends.\nNice, ""positive"", sunny perfume for summer but nothing unique I would recognize.', ""anna.dkr507/19/13 11:21I like the smell of roses. It reminds me of the rose garden my grandmother used to have when I was little. That said, this perfume doesn't smell like 'old lady'. Well, at least not to my nose. It's subtle, fresh, and puts a smile on my face. It' also somewhat soothing. I can smell the wormwood in the opening, then it's mostly rose with a hint of peach and tea on my skin. These are the notes I have been able to distinguish, so far. It's classy and sophisticated. It won't offend anyone unless you bathe in it.\nI'm going to test it a few more times, then perhaps get it with my Sephora discount card within the next couple of months."", ""pixiepuff03/16/13 10:37I agree with flowergirlsusie. This is lighter and fresher than the original Body edp, which I found could get quite sickly and a bit cloying (I imagine the edp would induce headaches in those that are sensitive). The apple in the opening of this EDT makes the scent crisp and airy. The apple note is not like the one in dkny delicious. I found it to be more like the note in the body shop apple shampoo from a long time ago. This perfume is also woodier than the edp and I found this to be enjoyable.

It\'s rather soft, sensual and feminine. I wouldn\'t wear this everyday, as I\'m more into unisex fragrances, but I do appreciate this one. Pricey.', ""dina07/01/12 07:53May give this one a try if it's softer that the original edp. Actually the latter is a very good one but way too sharp on my skin."", 'kaejuntun05/07/16 20:22Ahh yes... This is my favorite version of the Burberry Body line! The original was too heavy for me, but the EDT version strikes just the right pitch. It\'s an amped up clean skin scent on me - the apple is definitely there, but it\'s more tart than sweet, lending a crispness to the scent. Peach and rose are definitely prominent, just like the pyramid suggests. The original could definitely come across as a more ""mature"" scent, while I find the EDT much more versatile. The powder and woods are toned down, but still present in the dry down. Essentially, this Body smells like a combination of freshly washed skin, lotioned up, with some natural rosy muskiness. Clean and comfortable and elegant. Lovely and feminine. \n\nAnd BONUS! I am in love with the oil spray, and the EDT is much more similar to the oil than the original EDP is. A few squirts of the oil and one spritz of the perfume and the fragrance envelops me in a comfortable hug that hints at something more.. Just a touch more intimate than friendly, not quite sensual, but the chemistry\'s there. ;) <3', ""Wanesa08/03/15 16:22Not bad. I bought this for work. I needed something classy and not to heavy.

It doesn\'t want attention but it gets attention. It just lures you in . .\n\nI don\'t understand what\'s so ""gold"" about this. I thought it might be stronger, as in more musky, but it\'s not.

Very classy, rich and warm. A very wearable every day rose. I’m super picky about rose scents and while I like rose, some are so heavy and suffocating while others are too sharp and sour. This one is the perfect balance of everything. one of my favorite Burberry scents so far. \nI have yet to try the My Burberry flankers but I bet this is probably very similar to My Burberry Black.

You know that beautiful time of autumn, when it's warm and cosy, leaves are falling quietly and the sun hasn't set yet? When its golden rays are caressing your skin and everything is so perfect? Powdery, musky scent of Body Gold reminds me of those glorious days. It's a bit too light for my taste, but I kind of like it because it smells like an autumn evening.

It gives it a definite sharpness that the others don't have, I think the Iris comes through more in this one too. The musk & woods are done so well in all of the Body line.

It's along the style of YSL Paris with a twist. The originaL BB is a silage monster bordering on annoying if oversprayed. This one I've worn but a few times but silage and longevity were not an issue. I could smell it on myself for many hours. Nobody complimented or complained about the scent.

I was admittedly annoyed by these top notes, and had grave fears for what would follow.\n\nThankfully Burberry Body improves throughout its development. It\'s not an extremely loud fragrance, yet it does have good projection. Cashmere wood and sandalwood are the most dominant accords to my nose, followed by musk and creamy vanilla. The rose is very subtle, tending to be more sweet and fresh rather than tart-like"".\n\nI detected more peach and rose in the composition while wearing Burberry Body Rose Gold, and I suspect that the warm, sunny weather may have had something to do with that.

I actually initially thought they sent Burberry Brit Sheer, because this is closer to Sheer than Rhythm. I really get the passionfruit in this, it has a very specific kind of sweet tang that reminds me of fruity candy. Now that I see the notes, I realize that there is a slight aquatic vibe to this, but it didn't put me off the way aquatic notes usually do. The perfume also has that lilac soapiness. I think I smell almost every note listed, actually (aside from the caramel). It reminds me of the new, more aquatic version of Lucky You for Women, but with a large dose of passionfruit.

At first spritz I could detect a blend of clean, crisp florals with bright citrus notes. For the first few hours of wear Brit Rhythm Floral danced prettily on my skin as a fresh, easy to wear floral. \n\nThe more this fragrance developed however the sharper the citrus notes became with the aquatic aspects of this composition making themselves known in the heart. Aquatic fragrances tend to smell synthetic and jarring on my skin, and whilst they make great scents for Summer they don't agree with me.

Burberry Brit Rhythm for Women was launched in 2014. Burberry Brit Rhythm for Women was created by Natalie Gracia-Cetto and Antoine Maisondieu. Top notes are Lavender, Pink Pepper, Neroli and Aldehydes; middle notes are Orris, Petalia, Blackberry leaf and Orange Blossom; base notes are Musk, Woodsy Notes, Vetiver, Cedar and Coumarin. As a pair to this year's edition for men Burberry Brit Rhythm for Men, Burberry is presenting an edition for women signed by perfumers of the house of Givaudan, Nathalie Gracia-Cetto and Antoine Maisondieu. The new fragrances introduce ""aromatic and fresh English lavender from Kent that plays a key role in the composition, while orange and iris add a dose of sensuality.""
This is the first fragrance by Burberry that has lavender as a central note that plays the main role in the composition. English lavender is much more aromatic than French lavender, and its shades in this composition are more prominent. The creator's and the perfumer’s wish was to use the typical ingredient arriving from England, as pointed out by Nathalie Cetto. She also adds that the new Burberry perfume has a fundamental paradox in its essence – a confrontation of spicy ingredients such as pink pepper and floral notes of Petalia playing till the base notes. The scent of peony evokes youth and is somewhat lighter that the scent of rose, and the effect of the new Givaudan molecule provides the feeling that you are in a cloud of peony petals!
Top notes are composed of English lavender, pink pepper, and neroli, taking us to the heart of orris absolute, blackberry leaves, and orange blossom combined with a specially patented molecule of the house of Givaudan named Petalia carrying the scent of peony accords. The base incorporates vetiver, musk, and vibrant wood. 
Burberry Brit Rhythm for Women arrives as 30, 50, and 90 ml EDT. The offer also included 150 ml body lotion, 50 ml hair scent, 150 ml body wash, and 100 ml deodorant.
Just like the version for men Burberry Brit Rhythm for Men, the fragrance for women is closely connected with music and acoustic performance, explains Christopher Bailey. Like previous perfumes of the Burberry collection, the new fragrance for women features the DNA of the brand and follows the style of the house. Bailey adds, ""Rhythm for Women has the aim to capture emotion, excitement, and attitude that live music provides. That is truly a kind of adrenaline that you get from the music."" The color of the new perfume's liquid is soft pink and contains a powdery softness.
This fragrance was promoted and accompanied by a Burberry fashion line. The line included a special collection of leather jackets and smoky-eye make-up worn by Suki Waterhouse in a provocative video ad and black and white advertising campaign that also announced the new Burberry perfume edition. Bailey points out that from the launch of Burberry Brit Rhythm fragrance, clothes, purses, and nail polishes will be created to be wearable together, thanks to a new division in the house of Burberry.Read about this perfume in other languages: Deutsch, Español, Français, Čeština, Italiano, Русский, Polski, Português, Ελληνικά, 汉语, Nederlands, Srpski, Română, العربية, Українська, Монгол, עברית.",PerfumersAntoine MaisondieuNatalie Gracia-Cetto,

I went to sephora to buy one of them from my list, when I first entered the shop a salesman recommended me to test the BB Splash, with the first sniff I was blown away. Because like other aquatics scents this is not blue or oceanic. This one little melony and bit aquatic, it is a best blend for both. For those who like aquatic and fresh scents and like to try bit different I recommend this. But this is not for someone who expects a aventus or a tom ford style fragrances. This is a simple non complex scent and does its job of what it says. You will smell like you just splashed from a pond or a river. It lasts just like any other fresh scents.

It saves me from having to talk about notes. \n\nI think if you are an AdG purist you might not like this juice. I think for some people AdG is the classic fresh aquatic for men and that’s ok. However, this is perhaps what a younger AdG fan would wear at the beach. To my nose there is less lemon/citrus and more woods in here. Despite that I get a saltier note that reminds me of the ocean. Wearing it I get average projection and performance on this one. For a designer cologne I got this at an average price (~$40). Pack this one if you’re headed to the beach. \n\nVerdict:\n7.5/10 - Functions for me as a beachier flanker of AdG. While not original, it’s a better than average scent with decent projection and silliage. Price is average to below average. Safe blind buy. I’ve had my bottle a year and it’s half empty.

If you have any number of Acqua di Gio scents including but not limited to most Acqua di Gio flankers, Michael Jordan 23, Perry Ellis 360 Red (for men), Zegna Uomo, Liz Claiborne Curve Appeal or even Usher He, then Burberry Brit Splash is a fragrance you can skip on. \n\nI find that Brit Splash is a very light but melon heavy Acqua di Gio style aquatic. It lasts about 5 hours tops with an hour or so of soft to medium projection before becoming a total skin scent. It is entirely generic and unless you go to online retailers, you will find it highly over-priced for what you get, especially when you compare it to comparable scents that do what this does but actually better. Michael Jordan 23 is about the same note wise and is much cheaper for about the same sizes and gives the same performance. \n\nI would rate Burberry Brit Splash a 6.0 out of 10. Why, it isn't strong and is a dime-a-dozen scent that is sold often for inflated prices.

It's a very wearable warm weather scent that won't offend the majority of people who come into contact with it.

The original rose, ginger and tonka notes are now accompanied by the mandarin, grapefruit and bergamot in the opening for that summery feeling. The rest of the heart and dry down are identical to original Brit and since I love the original to bits, that's a good thing. Longevity and Projection are a tad lesser than the original but perfectly acceptable, projects well for the first couple of hours and lasts about 6 hours on skin.

For a comparison this juice reminds me a little of the creaminess you find in the dry down of the burberry london for men. The scent starts fresh just as you would expect for any other summer type fragrance but after the initial spray the scent gets very warm and inviting. Typically when i smell summer fragrances they are very light and livey and want to make you energetic but this is dfferent. There is a very calming and almost dessert like quality to this. Almost similar to the cream of a key lime pie if that makes any sense. By drawing these together it seems that the summer edition is close to a chanel edition blanche, now i personally havent smelled blanche but from what i have been hearing it is very similar to the burberry summer edition just that blanche is more fruity with lemon instead of the lime in the summer edition. Overall this fragrance is a definite try for the curious buyer, it is only offered in 100ml so I would not recommend buying this but try it on your skin because the dry down and base is what really makes this scent very pleasing.

The woods are very soft and vetiver adds a little dryness which overall gives a less powdery finish. I am a great fan of Burberry Brit and will make a lot of use out of this Summer edition. If you didn't like the baby powderness in the original, or thought it was too rosy, try this, it will make your Summer different not only for you but for those around you as well."", ""PolyOlfaction05/17/15 02:50Wow, ginger overload! This has nothing to do with summer though, it's a very feminine scent that could be worn any time of the year. Definitely not a date scent. More of a casual, any time of day, with friends and family scent. Also a good work scent. Fresh, clean and safe.\n\nIt may be too feminine for some guys.\n\nScent 5/10\nLongevity 5/10\nSillage 5/10\n\nExtremely average. (Mind the oxymoron.)""]"

Too strong on the lime","['MTK8210/22/23 14:35Very bright, fruity yummy scent! So fresh and vibrant....two sprays are enough! Puts one in a good mood, a blind buy for those who like bright and sunny scents.', 'savannalove0712/06/22 12:19I bought my first bottle at Marshall’s 5+ years ago? Love the limey sparkling opening and cozy almonds notes. When I finished the bottle, it was discontinued & couldn’t find it anymore with a decent price. Got an opened bottle 3/4 full recently from Poshmark & the refreshing top notes are gone and all the other notes are dulled. \nI’ll finish the bottle. Maybe if I had bought a new in box bottle it’ll smell better? Who knows? Just be careful when you buy an opened one, you might be disappointed.', ""bossmama06/20/22 08:19Potent and leaning masculine. The tea note here isn't calming at all. Perhaps should've gotten the original EDT/EDP instead."", 'Tinabill06/05/22 03:55I have a tester bottle that looks exactly as shown (vertical - not diagonal -white plaid design, tho without the cap) but labeled Burberry Limited EDT only, no Brit or Summer anywhere on the bottle or sticker. The sticker on the back states very similar notes but with some subtle differences to those on Fragrantica, they are as follows:\nTop notes: lime, icy pear, green almonds (not tea)\nHeart notes: white peony, sugared almonds\nBase notes: mahogany wood, amber, vanilla beans ( not musk)\n\nThis fragrance opens with a crisp, zingy, bright and very fresh lime note that manages not to be sharp, is slightly green without being bitter. Within an hour it gives way to a delicately sweet “wedding” almond note, then it rests on a very smooth wood and vanilla/amber base. This phase lasts for maybe 4 more hours but is very close to the skin. \nIn the excruciating summer heat I don’t mind reapplying it every hour to enjoy the refreshing initial limeade blast. \nOverall it’s an easy grab for hot summer days when you need a zing but still crave some sweetness 😊', 'dglightblue12/22/21 18:10My bottle of this fragrance with the same name edp and all, is designed like the burberry brit gold, red, and brit sheer. \nFrom what I c tell burberry brit edp has the larger plaid design with bigger black stripes, mine is fine print with more like pinstripe plaid - in the same colour pallet.\n\nMy bottle is more sheer feing than recent burberry brit edp I have tested, the latter one is much more pronounced.\nBoth bottles have that same warm sweet wool nutty smell, with a cosy freshness. The lime is not at all citrus or dry, the pear is not fruity per se, perhaps lends a gentle sweet facet.\n\nI very much enjoy the bottle with the larger print, i might use to swap/sell this one I have. Both are nice but just a preference.', 'marysunroyse09/25/21 03:18One of my first ever perfumes.\nVery easy to wear, and affordable.\n\nThe opening is very heavy in lime and tea for me, with a hint of sweetness from the pear. \n\nThat citrus and tea scent stays through the whole journey, but becomes more mellow, sweet with pear and somewhat smooth, thanks to the almond, and musk. \n\nAn easy buy, not overwhelming and very pleasant. Good purchase for a sensitive nose, amazing for the summer and good throughout the whole year. \n\nThe sillage is pretty weak unless over sprayed, the longevity is great.', ""Cherihanei12/28/20 07:56The opening is very citrusy, fresh and clean but it quickly deepens into a vanillic, almondy ambery scent. It's not exactly pleasing, nor is it disgusting. Very warm and cozy. Feminine and not too in your face. I don't get much pear to be honest, not a fruity perfume at all, BUT the tea is here somewhere behind if you pay attention. I find Brit Summer way better, more airy and subtle than Brit. Although both are immensely sweet which is why I stopped wearing them after 20. This is not a very mature scent. I place this on the same line asLa Vie est Belle or Black Opium... young girly girl perfumes. It's definitely a day scent, uncomplicated, smooth and happy. Smells like garden afternoons to me !"", ""gtabasso06/28/19 07:53In the top this is very very fresh. It reminds me of Elizabeth Arden Green Tea meets Shalimar Souffle de Lumiere. Lots of citrus, some tea and a little bit of baked lemon goods. There's peony and musk in the mix. Those are the notes for me. Not too complex. Wonderful for summer if you like sweet and citrus. It's much fresher and less dark and sultry than the Shalimar flankers."", 'pamelalasalle11001/17/19 11:13I am in love once again with one of many fragrances by Burberry. A real delight. Those who want to compare it to Brit EDP or EDT, although nice in their own right, would be mistaken. There is no tonka, vanilla, or sugar present in this fragrance. Instead smooth green tea, and soft musk are added to the traditional peony and green almond. The warm amber and dark wood in Brit Summer is much lighter as well, leaving way for the musky, citrusy, almondy freshness of this fragrance. A nice warm weather fragrance that has very good longevity and silage for an EDT. Good for any occasion, can definitely be worn without offending others.', ""Erinbath2212/27/17 11:30Delicious, delicious! I instantly and easily loved Brit summer. Light, fresh, sweet citrusy. Now this scent reminds me of Disneyland since I wore it there and I could smell it all day. It takes more sprays to get longevity but get some on your shirt and you'll be catching yummy candied pear-citrus whiffs all day. \n\nThis is so fresh-sweet it is mouthwatering. I love lime and pear. Tea gives it a calming property and ensures this never becomes overly sweet or screechy. The sugared almond keeps it mellow-sweet. A perfect balance of calm/energy/fresh. \nWear this for a friendly perk-up, or for summer of course. \nTry this if Brit was too heavy. \nI think I am officially a Burberry groupie. Now, time to scour the web for an extra bottle as back-up. Summer lasts 6 months here!! I'd love my summer to smell of this."", 'Ryanmmas2612/05/17 11:46To start off I’m a man and I got this fragrance by mistake as I ordered the original Burberry Brit for men but got this instead.\n\nBUT I looked at the note breakdown at the back of the bottle and thought the note breakdown looked interesting so I decided to give it a shot and I was pleasantly surprised at how good this smelled. After smelling this I was actually confused as this smells like it could be a mans fragrance or unisex at least as it smells VERY similar to Givenchy PI and due to the mahogany note in this I’d even say this is also more masculine than PI.\n\nTo describe the scent on its own this opens up with a nice blast of lime,tea and almond giving this a very smooth but fresh and relaxing smell.Once this dries down the citrus and tea stays in the background but then the almond and mahogany take over giving this a milky but deep masculine touch. I really love the Mahogany note in this which is similar to the Mahogany note in Mahogany Woods by Bath and Body Works. All in all I love this smell and it smells like a half lemonade/half iced tea mix if you then applied almond milk. It sounds weird but this stuff is delicious smelling and great for all seasons for both Men and Women.\n\nPerformance on this is great as it lasts 6-12 hours and this doesn’t project very well BUT it does leave a nice Sillage and you will get whiffs if this hours later.\n\nNeedless to say even though I got sent this by mistake I’m going to end up keeping this hidden gem and I actually like this scent better than Brit anyways !\n\nFirst initial wearing review — 8 out of 10 ! Unique smell with a great blend of notes that’s good for all season', ""Ivanus10/05/17 07:01Fragrance -Burberry Brit Summer for Women\nBottle from - 2016\n\nBurberry Brit Summer is an intriguing and sensual fragrance that goes from fresh,clean,green and citrusy scent to a nice moderately sweet,woody and powdery mix of musk,pear, amber and almond as it settles into the skin.\n\nLongevity - 7/10(7+hours)\nSilage/Projection - 6/10(soft to moderate projection and silage for the first 2-3 hours)\nWeather - best in best in spring,summer and early autumn\nAge - 20+ \nCompliments - 8/10\nScent - 7/10\n\nMain notes according to me - lime,tea,pear,almond,musk,flowers.\n\nThe drydown is nice and i get some woodiness,musk,amber and almond. \n\nEmotions -fresh,pleasant,sensual,bright,clean,relax,casual.\n\nOccasion -for more or less any ocasion,perfect for casual activities and office.\n\nCould be a nice signature scent.You'll get compliments with this one."", ""Linda JK08/22/17 08:35I have a like-dislike relationship with this fragrance and have more than once considered giving it away. I'm glad I didn't. \n\nI finally realized that what kinda spoils this fragrance for me is the green tea and lime, which initially open strong and sharp (in my opinion). \n\nFor this reason, I never spray it on my neck since it would be overpowering and screechy. If you must use it behind your ears, use the dab method. The wrists and inner elbow are best for sprays.\n\nOnce it dries down, the soft almond and amber come through leaving a creamy, warm scent. \n\nThe sillage can be strong if you use a heavy hand, but this doesn't typically last to the end of the day without re-spraying. Longevity might be better when sprayed on clothing.\n\nI initially thought that this fragrance was best used in the summer as it's likely to project a lot better in warmer weather. Nope. I tried using it during the summer once and ended up with a headache-inducing cloying mess. My body chemistry doesn't do well with green tea and lime/lemon notes in warm weather, but I carry them flawlessly in colder months.\n\nBurberry Brit has lemon in it, yet I find it to be a lot more wearable than Brit Summer. So if I were to pick between the two, I'd go for the original Brit. \n\nI would suggest testing Brit Summer before you buy it, as those tart notes may not work well for everyone. I don't regret this blind-buy and I'm glad I held on to it."", 'Lockon02/08/17 12:52Safe scent for any woman.\nI bought this for my ex.\nShe loved it and it smeled wonderful on her.\nLast about six to seven hours.\nWould buy it again.\nIt only cost $20 for a 3.4 Oz bottle.', ""lilybet1112/28/16 14:01In general, I'm a fan of the Burberry Brit family of scents, and I think that Burberry Brit Summer EDT is a nice addition to it. This scent opens with a strong lime/pear blast that is way too bright for fall/winter. Am sure this would be refreshing in the summer - which is, obviously, it's intended season. The tea shows up shortly afterwards, but on my skin, the lime dominates for a couple of hours. Eventually, it settles into a slightly sweet peony/tea scent with a hint of amber for me. I look forward to revisiting in the appropriate season.\n\nLongevity - 6-7 hours\nSillage - moderate for first 2 hours, soft for the next 4, then fades almost completely away\nSeason - most definitely summer"", ""beautyscent$12/19/15 08:24Very masculine and too strong on the lime...

Sprayed twice. US only please. \n\nI bought this blind hoping that it would be like the original Brit. I do like it but I'm missing the vanilla almond dry down that the original has. That is my favorite part. This smells like a green tea with fresh squeezed lime in it. Not bad at all but not my favorite."", 'daynierds03/28/15 04:02Hi ladies, here a male short take on this...\nI just bought it for a girl...it was a blind buy, what can I say? we were not dissapointed at all...it smells nice and citrusy in a nice feminine flowery way...something quite different to be honest...but in a good way...very distintive and feminine...you can feel there is quality in it...not cheap smelling at all and I guess a useful one in everybody´s collection...', 'Bloodlust01/20/15 22:22This Brit flanker opens up with a green tea/citrus combination, with the addition of a really juicy pear. You can grasp a hint of these notes in the original Brit, but you can tell right off the bat this is going to be a much fresher version!\n\nThe heart is pretty close in comparison to the original Brit - the musky, almost-powdered-rice-or-osmanthus-like quality of sweet yet bitter almonds. Fizzy and slightly musky, but the tea throughout the fragrance makes Brit Summer a little more crisp and sheer. Sometimes I get bits of Honeysuckle flower (real life flower, not ""In perfumery"" flower!), amongst the heart notes, though it is not listed here.\n\nI feel this is a flanker situation where if you have one, you don\'t need the other - though I do find these are two bottles that are pleasant for winter vs. summer. Overall, when comparing the original vs. flanker side by side, I think Brit Summer wins me over with it\'s added freshness! It avoids any chance of the scent becoming cloying as it wears on.\n\nSoft sillage, and decent longevity! I can always smell it all throughout a 7+ hour work day, and then some. Which surprised me, for a fruity tea scent! A nice addition to a collection that needs some uplifting notes.', 'BlackDressBlondHair07/17/14 08:39This is a nice perfume, you can really smell the pear. But I would like it more, if it had more depth.', ""Englishrose407/13/14 03:28This a fresh green scent with a hint of sweetness, it has been very humid and sticky, thunderstorms etc where I am and I have found in these conditions this scent really comes into it's own, it smells great for oppressive weather and gives you a feeling of clean zingeyness.\n\nI agree with Christinavictory about being reminiscent of a mojito, I totally got that yesterday evening during a storm!\n\nFor me it starts full on lime tea and green pear, as it warms on your skin you get a sweet peony and creamy almond finally vanilla musk woodsey notes, very nice indeed could unisex in my opinion.\n\nI've found wearing it with dove body lotion seems to complement it well, I think it brings out the almond scent which stops it being to sharp.\n\nFor EDT I found it's staying power good, though you feel so fresh when you put it on I did respray 2 or 3 times yesterday even though 1 or 2 would have been enough. \n\nI'm really pleased with this and it will be my go to in hot humid weather.\n\nRecommended to my friend who got a spritz on paper in the shop during her lunch break and it smelt horrid, when she sprayed mine on her skin she couldn't believe the difference they smelt like different scents, so make sure you try on your skin otherwise you might be unnecessarily put off a lovely scent."", ""stayclassy06/17/14 19:07I almost didn't buy this. Citrus fragrances always scare me because I'm afraid they're going to be too sharp. But thank goodness, there really isn't any sharpness to this. \n\nIt's like the lime was sugared down, I think someone mentioned lemonade? I totally get it! Like a super juicy half tea, half lemonade. I know there's no lemons in here, or technically straight sugar, but somehow that's what comes through in the beginning and it's awesome. It softens a bit to the peony but never quite loses the lemonade factor. \n\nThat may be a negative for some, but for a fun summer fragrance I think it's great, both for the really hot days and for the light rainy days. It only comes in an EDT, but it's pretty long lasting for an EDT so at least there's that."", ""dad05/17/14 14:26EDIT: I've got a 3.4 oz bottle of this (sprayed 2-3 times, 99% full) up for swap! Contact me if you're interested ^-^\n\n\nJust got this today in the mail!\nI sniffed the trigger, and was slightly alarmed because all I could smell was bitter pears. \nLuckily, it did not smell that way when applied on my skin.\nFirst thing I notice is limes. Not the sweet candied lime, the real thing. \nSecond thing was a white flower of some sort (that I now can identify as peony.) It gave a ladylike undertone to the limey scent, but this perfume is really complex on me.\nThe limes and peony stand out the most within the first hour or so. It then develops a new side, losing that citrus edge and becoming fruitier. Like icy pears.\nIt dries down to a musky amber with traces of tea.\nOverall, it's a nice scent but probably for the 25+ crowd. \nIts fresh, citrusy, and musky. A little bit bitter. \nI can appreciate it for what it is, but for a 16 year old, its a little bit of a joykill (at least for a summer fragrance). \nObviously this doesn't apply to anyone who enjoys fresh, sophisticated, fruity fragrances! It is still such a beautiful scent, and I like it much more than the original Brit, but I probably won't be wearing it much. \nEnd thoughts: If you liked Brit, but want a fresher version, I'd say give this a try!"", 'christinavictory03/21/14 12:54I finally got this in the mail! Burberry Brit Sheer is one of my absolute favorite fragrances, but I had never before smelled Burberry Brit. Well, the other day I did go to the store and test the original Burberry Brit, and it just smelled TERRIBLE on me. Anyways, I got really nervous and then I read on here that Brit summer was similar to the original...and I was going to cancel, but the person I bought it from had already shipped it. I figured I might as well try it, and I am SO GLAD I didn\'t cancel it. This smells absolutely nothing like the original Brit. \n\nI love London, it\'s one of my favorite places in the world, but there is nothing about this fragrance that screams ""British!"" to me. Instead, it screams ""Cuba!"" The description does not say that there is any mint or sugar in this fragrance, but I can distinctly smell both along with a strong lime and a little bit of rum. Essentially, this fragrance smells EXACTLY like drinking a mojito in a garden of peonies. It really brings me back to Havana. I LOVE it, A++\n\nEdit: the dry down is a bit reminiscent of Burberry Brit. I like it way better in the beginning, but the beginning last several hours on me. While there are some similarities in the dry down, this is still a lot better than the original.', 'kathrinaaguir03/16/14 14:02Sorry, but this one smells like smashed rotten lemon. Not for me.', 'cherry_lips01/07/14 06:26This creation by Burberry house was in my test list, but when I saw that many of you find similarities with the original Brit,I desided it\'s not worthed trying it, because I don\'t like vanilla in perfumes. \nToday I was in the mall and I saw it on the shelf and I thought to myself ""OK, why not?"".

Despite the difference in notes on the list, they both start with nearly identical burst of citrus, while in Brit citrus soon gives way to pear and tea in 5TH Avenue Style it stays for much longer with dominant rasberry and spice. It the end they are still, two very similar scents.. with brit being sweeter not so in your face fume.\n\nThis is a refreshing, soft, creamy and very wearable scent, perfect for a hot summers day.', 'joliejodie09/25/13 09:33smells great from the bottle, smells lame on me :( Hopefully I can find the normal Brit one day and see how that goes.', ""Tiffanymr07/14/13 06:38So refreshing! Burst of icy lime and pear, lightly sugared almond heart with a fresh, yet sensual drydown of amber, wood and white musk. Light, sexy fragrance for summer. It brought the image of sitting in an adirondak chair whose wood has been warmed by the sun and body heat on the back porch overlooking a lake. You're with someone special, sharing smiles and the occasional laugh. A vase of lightly scented flowers sits on a side table with a selection of iced tea, sparkling limeade with iced pear cubes and sugared almonds. A rather safe scent, but lovely."", ""gangel0406/23/13 14:11This gem has surprising longevity for an edt. I sprayed it on at 9am this morning, and now at 5pm I can still smell it when I bring my arm up to my face. Other than the almondy base this perfume doesn't really resemble the original brit to me. It's dominated by the lemon note from the beginning to just before the end. The pear note is pretty prevalent throughout. My experience with this surprised me somewhat because I had read about how similar this fragrance was to the original, but I was not surprised in a bad way.\n\nThis fragrance is pretty fantastic. It's the sprite to the original brit's latte if that makes sense. Where the original brit is more creamy this one has a little more bite. It smells fresh and clean without being soapy or sterile. I would say that it could be unisex, but it leans very much more towards the feminine, and I'm sure that's mostly because of the pear involved.\n\nAll in all, I'm happy I purchased this one (at a discount from groupon *Cheer*).

It`s too heavy and strong.', ""missk09/30/12 23:33Burberry Brit Summer may have a similar scent pyramid to that of the original, but I can't say that they smell exactly alike. I much prefer this Summer flanker. It's softer, fresher and fruitier.\n\nAnyone that follows my reviews, will know that I don't usually enjoy fruity fragrances. There are only a few fruit notes that I like, and pear and lime are two of them. These two notes, when blended together, create a scent that is sweet, green, juicy, soft and feminine. Thankfully nothing in this fragrance comes across as being too overbearing.\n\nBrit Summer is a really delicate fragrance. It is far more subdued than the original Brit, which often turned sharp on my skin. I would most definitely reach for this flanker during Summer.\n\nThe heart is well balanced with sweet, mashed pears, green lime, soapy peony and sugared almonds. It's almost a gourmand, however I'd describe it as being more crisp and clean.\n\nThe musky drydown is even more pleasant, striking me as being rather sensual and soothing. If only this Summer flanker wasn't a limited edition. It's one of my pet peeves when brands discontinue limited edition flankers, especially when they smell better than the originals.\n\nThe sillage of Brit Summer is fairly light and inoffensive. The lasting strength could have been better, but it's certainly not disappointing. My word to the wise is to go out and test this flanker as soon as possible. I fear that its existence will be short-lived."", ""Tsukinohime09/30/12 05:42Good choice for those who find the original a bit too cloying. A very fresh scent with a hint of sweetness in it. Almost certainly feminine, but not to a point of being girly girl. Just got this myself hours ago and so far I'm enjoying it. I got lots of green tea freshness which is balanced by the sweetness of the sugared almonds. I like it that way as it keeps the scent from becoming too syrupy sweet because of the sugared almonds or too bitter-green by the green tea. Of course other ingredients also affected the composition in some ways, but as a whole it is certainly to me a pretty balanced concoction. As I said, fresh yet sweet. Staying power is pretty decent for an EDT. This one is a sure compliment getter, provided if you use it in just the right amount. Highly recommended for just about any occasion, be it office or a special event. It is not so heavy so it is suitable for both day and night wear."", 'Adureeuh09/15/12 10:00I love this summer version of brit! I usually go for sweet perfumes, which I both love and hate, so I bought this to balance out my perfume wardrobe. It smells really good, sexy, fresh, and somewhat spicy/woody. I got this instead of the original brit because I wanted to stay away from the vanilla sweet drydown a lot of people comment on. Even though it\'s ""fruity"" in a sense, it\'s not a super sweet, victoria\'s secret type of fruity. I think it\'s quite strong and could be a good work perfume if you spray lightly. It\'s a perfect end of summer, going into fall perfume, as it is a green, fresh scent, but also gives you a spicy warmth and good lasting power.', ""Lovely12306/12/12 10:36I hate this smell.

What I did experience was a gradual increase in dewiness of a cool, green, minimalistic scent which evoked memories of sun-warmed blades of summer grass and the green Bumble and Bumble Seaweed shampoo I used to love a long time ago.\n\nAnd just as I was beginning to think this clean, fresh, green, and somewhat unisex fragrance would be perfect for hot summer weather, I walked outside into the cold rainy morning, and realized this is a perfect ""California Winter"" scent for my skin.', 'christinavictory03/21/14 12:54I finally got this in the mail! Burberry Brit Sheer is one of my absolute favorite fragrances, but I had never before smelled Burberry Brit. Well, the other day I did go to the store and test the original Burberry Brit, and it just smelled TERRIBLE on me. Anyways, I got really nervous and then I read on here that Brit summer was similar to the original...and I was going to cancel, but the person I bought it from had already shipped it. I figured I might as well try it, and I am SO GLAD I didn\'t cancel it. This smells absolutely nothing like the original Brit. \n\nI love London, it\'s one of my favorite places in the world, but there is nothing about this fragrance that screams ""British!"" to me. Instead, it screams ""Cuba!"" The description does not say that there is any mint or sugar in this fragrance, but I can distinctly smell both along with a strong lime and a little bit of rum. Essentially, this fragrance smells EXACTLY like drinking a mojito in a garden of peonies. It really brings me back to Havana. I LOVE it, A++\n\nEdit: the dry down is a bit reminiscent of Burberry Brit. I like it way better in the beginning, but the beginning last several hours on me. While there are some similarities in the dry down, this is still a lot better than the original.', ""Englishrose407/13/14 03:28This a fresh green scent with a hint of sweetness, it has been very humid and sticky, thunderstorms etc where I am and I have found in these conditions this scent really comes into it's own, it smells great for oppressive weather and gives you a feeling of clean zingeyness.\n\nI agree with Christinavictory about being reminiscent of a mojito, I totally got that yesterday evening during a storm!\n\nFor me it starts full on lime tea and green pear, as it warms on your skin you get a sweet peony and creamy almond finally vanilla musk woodsey notes, very nice indeed could unisex in my opinion.\n\nI've found wearing it with dove body lotion seems to complement it well, I think it brings out the almond scent which stops it being to sharp.\n\nFor EDT I found it's staying power good, though you feel so fresh when you put it on I did respray 2 or 3 times yesterday even though 1 or 2 would have been enough. \n\nI'm really pleased with this and it will be my go to in hot humid weather.\n\nRecommended to my friend who got a spritz on paper in the shop during her lunch break and it smelt horrid, when she sprayed mine on her skin she couldn't believe the difference they smelt like different scents, so make sure you try on your skin otherwise you might be unnecessarily put off a lovely scent."", 'Ryanmmas2612/05/17 11:46To start off I’m a man and I got this fragrance by mistake as I ordered the original Burberry Brit for men but got this instead.\n\nBUT I looked at the note breakdown at the back of the bottle and thought the note breakdown looked interesting so I decided to give it a shot and I was pleasantly surprised at how good this smelled. After smelling this I was actually confused as this smells like it could be a mans fragrance or unisex at least as it smells VERY similar to Givenchy PI and due to the mahogany note in this I’d even say this is also more masculine than PI.\n\nTo describe the scent on its own this opens up with a nice blast of lime,tea and almond giving this a very smooth but fresh and relaxing smell.Once this dries down the citrus and tea stays in the background but then the almond and mahogany take over giving this a milky but deep masculine touch. I really love the Mahogany note in this which is similar to the Mahogany note in Mahogany Woods by Bath and Body Works. All in all I love this smell and it smells like a half lemonade/half iced tea mix if you then applied almond milk. It sounds weird but this stuff is delicious smelling and great for all seasons for both Men and Women.\n\nPerformance on this is great as it lasts 6-12 hours and this doesn’t project very well BUT it does leave a nice Sillage and you will get whiffs if this hours later.\n\nNeedless to say even though I got sent this by mistake I’m going to end up keeping this hidden gem and I actually like this scent better than Brit anyways !\n\nFirst initial wearing review — 8 out of 10 ! Unique smell with a great blend of notes that’s good for all season', 'pamelalasalle11001/17/19 11:13I am in love once again with one of many fragrances by Burberry. A real delight. Those who want to compare it to Brit EDP or EDT, although nice in their own right, would be mistaken. There is no tonka, vanilla, or sugar present in this fragrance. Instead smooth green tea, and soft musk are added to the traditional peony and green almond. The warm amber and dark wood in Brit Summer is much lighter as well, leaving way for the musky, citrusy, almondy freshness of this fragrance. A nice warm weather fragrance that has very good longevity and silage for an EDT. Good for any occasion, can definitely be worn without offending others.', ""stayclassy06/17/14 19:07I almost didn't buy this. Citrus fragrances always scare me because I'm afraid they're going to be too sharp. But thank goodness, there really isn't any sharpness to this. \n\nIt's like the lime was sugared down, I think someone mentioned lemonade? I totally get it! Like a super juicy half tea, half lemonade. I know there's no lemons in here, or technically straight sugar, but somehow that's what comes through in the beginning and it's awesome. It softens a bit to the peony but never quite loses the lemonade factor. \n\nThat may be a negative for some, but for a fun summer fragrance I think it's great, both for the really hot days and for the light rainy days. It only comes in an EDT, but it's pretty long lasting for an EDT so at least there's that."", ""bossmama06/20/22 08:19Potent and leaning masculine. The tea note here isn't calming at all.

I get a hint of cumin and there's a good and rich, natural vanillic base. The lavender and especially the rose is primarily here just to smooth things out - the rose does take center stage briefly in the mid dry down, especially if your skin heats up. Thisnrose accord smells like a baby wipe, and that's not a bad thing to my nose. Over the cool green woody aromatic base it pulls the fragrance towards fougere category. Mostly the rose functions like the rose in Memoir Man, a glue to bond and smooth the notes together. \n\nIt smells a bit like Memoir too, even sharing a bit of cool green minty wormwood effect, but it doesn't have the liquorice notes. It stays greener, simpler, and again leaning more classically fougere. \n\nOther points of reference are Andrea Mack Coven (share some greenness, though no clove here and less earthy overall), and the aforementioned Joop Homme Absolute and Wonderoud. They all share black pepper and some smooth, velvety wood synthetic (pashminol?). Whatever that chemical is I absolutely love it. I'd recommend just going with the Joop for most, it's far less expensive and has more of a creaminess in its florals that probably makes it more mass appealing. This is drier but more elegant - it doesn't try as hard to please as Joop and thus registers as more mature. \n\nOne last point of reference is Guichards very own Bleu Turquoise for Armani. The way Guichard combined the incense, black pepper and vanilla into the core accord of that scent is identifiable here, too. The rest of the drapings are completely different so the scents don't really smell alike, but that smooth and sweet peppery richness is here too, this time in shades of purple and green. Bleu Turquoise? No, this time it's Mysterious Alexandrite.""]"

Then you get a fruity undertone with the Mandarin Orange, and you still have some depth with the beautiful Sandalwood note, going along perfectly well with the Musk and Pink Pepper.\n\nThe only problems encountered with the flanker is the atomizer being defectuous I had to find another one to exchange it with the original one. And the opening of the fragrance is really alcoholy to me, if I spray a bit much it kinda sting my eyes a bit so be careful.

Always check each details if you wanna do the same, to be sure you got an authentic fragrance and not a knockoff.\n\nA must if you are a pink girly girl, but you have to know that it doesn't last quite good, you definitely need to reapply it after 1~3h.

Not for me but if somebody sprayed this on me, I wouldn’t be bummed. The mandarin orange adds just a noticeable touch of sweetness. It doesn’t smell orange at all, just gives a nice sweet twist to an otherwise clean floral fragrance. The sandalwood is soft and a great addition. Her Blossom smells mildly expensive to me, so I’d say it was really well-made. I only have a sample though so I can’t judge projection or longevity (those tiny sprays just can’t compare to the big daddy sprays!). It’s an EDT though so it might not be the best performer… I know personally I had Burberry Her EDT (the green bottle) and I swear it’d last 5 minutes before it was POOF gone and I never got compliments wearing it so idk if others couldn’t smell it on me either.

For someone who wants a fresh floral, this is very nice. But correct given that it is an EDT it does not last long. \n\nIt opens basically with a strong ode to MFK a la Rose l'eau, which is strange because the listed notes do not contain rose. A la Rose is a very fresh rose with a touch of citrus so somehow here the peony, plum blossom and orange must combine to produce a similar scent. My nose does not detect any pepper nor any resemblance to Her Intense, maybe a similar musk in the dry down. I also catch a bit of MFK Amryis Femme in the middle notes. \n\nThis is a very beautiful floral that is nice for work, easy breezy summer dinners, and the beach.

4.26,5,5,Clinique,"['amber', 'rose', 'fresh spicy', 'floral', 'warm spicy']",Beyond Rose Clinique for women,"Beyond Rose by Clinique is a Amber Floral fragrance for women. Beyond Rose was launched in 2014. The nose behind this fragrance is Alienor Massenet. Top notes are Mate and White Pepper; middle notes are Rose Oil, Rose, Osmanthus and Freesia; base notes are Amber, Labdanum, Styrax and Benzoin. Clinique announces the new fragrance based on rose flower, such that we have not had the opportunity to try yet. Airy layers construct the intense scent enriched and warmed with amber, while the real shock comes from tart notes of pepper! ""Modern, clean and sophisticated, this is the fragrance of today and tomorrow!""—as mentioned by the brand Clinique.
Fragrance Clinique Beyond Rose provides an extremely seductive composition. Rose as the key note of the fragrance will offer countless layers, from soft and gentle ones, silky shades of petals, to the dark and velvety essence of the flower. Its beauty is elevated by warm and cuddly amber, which adds resin-like sweetness and depth to the composition. An interesting twist comes from pepper, which provides an unforgettable trail thanks to its fine sweetness and gentle tartness, and gives the signature to the new Clinique perfume. The fragrance contains scents of white pepper, rose oil and rose absolute, freesia flowers, osmanthus blossom, mate leaves, warmed and deepened by amber, labdanum, styrax and benzoin.
Beyond Rose from Clinique arrives in flacons with relief ornaments and is available as 100 ml Perfume Spray.Read about this perfume in other languages: Deutsch, Español, Français, Čeština, Italiano, Русский, Polski, Português, Ελληνικά, 汉语, Nederlands, Srpski, Română, العربية, Українська, Монгол, עברית.",PerfumerAlienor Massenet,"['Biljana Prijovic Milovano08/22/23 04:46Magic in bottle.', 'LSAUG07/24/22 06:17Beyond Rose reminds me of Calligraphy Rose by Aramis but instead of lavender and oregano for top notes to add lift and freshness this accomplishes freshness w/ mate tea. The black pepper is nice here and not to strong. The roses here are freshly bloomed and tart but on the verge of becoming jammy and sweet. Beautiful resinous dry down.

I'm always looking always for the perfect Rose perfume. This isnt it. It smells exactly like that thick orange iodine that they paint on you when you go into operating theatre for an operation. Exactly like that when you spray it on.... Then it mellows down to a thin monosylable turkish delight. Theres no intensity, it lasts max 30 mins until it entirely disappears. Huge disappointment. I bought three 15 ml samples they are all the same. Glad I didnt stump for the full bottle, couldnt find one that wasnt ridiculously priced. Thats unusual for me as I usually buy blind and buy 100ml bottles. Only twice have I been disappointed out of 40. This is a waster of money. It was made for the wealthy Arabic market who shop at Harrods were it was sold.. NO ROSE.. So in that sense the name is accurate, its BEYOND ROSE.... Sad as I had such high hopes. I wore Clinique AE as my signature scent for many years.. If you want to test this I can send you a sample if you DM me."", 'wwwyncly02/09/21 22:14Candied roses. The opening has a sweet and sour taste, and as it dries, it becomes an increasingly light rose aroma. This stage is super long lasting, like a mist, suitable for all ages from young to mature. I sometimes use it to overlap with other perfumes to increase the level.', 'BillieNG01/08/21 14:52Exquisite! You don\'t have a perfume called ""Beyond rose"". You have at least 4 or 5 at the same time. It behaves totally different depending on nothing particular. Mind you I have been detesting oud since they started to use fake one as shop aroma diffusers in my country. Sometimes I feel as if the entire city has soaked up this bloody- hairy-fluffy- cloying - cheap -artificial-modern-whatwasitsname-unbearable stuff. This here case is not the same at all! This here oud, though non-existent according to the description, is the finest and most delicate note I have ever smelled. Amazing! It is all about blending, guys. All about blending. I love it from top to bottom. From the almost medicinal top-notes to the . delicious dry down. If it\'s rosy - let it be rosy. If it\'s spicy - let it be spicy. Call it whatever you like. The rose is drizzling down its liqueur over the bark of a honeyed agarwood tree. A masterpiece!', 'uno12/16/20 04:26MY LOVE!', ""alphairone12/08/20 06:32Clinique Beyond Rose is an accessible yet fine-tuned and expertly blended rose oud, where the oud doesn't command but plays a supporting role (for once, as I tend to avoid the bombastic oud notes that have saturated the market in the past eight or so years, screechy clodhoppers that demand attention with near hostility). I felt like once I had Beyond Rose in my possession, there wasn't much need for another rose oud. The funny thing is: according to the note pyramid, there is no oud, so perhaps we have some sort of illusion of oud through the marriage of all other components. \n\nBR sings, it doesn't scream and there's a dryness and sheerness that makes it a comforting wear on cold mornings. There is a natural quality coming from the herbal mate note in the opening that counterbalances the pepper and rose, while the heart really reveals the mildly sweet sheerness that can be attributed to the osmanthus and freesia, two notes that experienced noses know can go in very different directions depending on the fragrance. Here, they are nuanced, yet lively, imparting a lift to the deeper richer elements that are the foundation of the composition. The rose itself is sustained through much of the development; solid, reliable, more green than luscious, but vibrant. \n\nThe base is where BR reveals itself as a true Arabian delight: the styrax, benzoin, and labdanum are create an accord that is arid and leathery, exotic and something that one would not expect from a Clinique release (apparently this was intended for the Middle Eastern market and we are lucky to have it within reach in the states at least while supplies last). Its quality is something that could be expected from Serge Lutens or dare I say, Frederic Malle, as it is just so cohesive, no rough edges, so pleasing to the nose, and a true joy to wear. This is definitely unisex, leaning masculine at times."", 'jæ11/04/20 17:43I discovered this incredible perfume thanks to a fellow Fragrantican friend (thank you, Anamandy!) who kindly sent me a sample after hearing me rave about other rose fragrances I love (specifically MFK Oud Satin Mood). I am so glad she clued me into Beyond Rose, and that I was able to find a reasonably priced bottle. Why in the world this was discontinued, I\'ll never understand. \n\nIt\'s really hard to do anything new with rose, so ubiquitous it is in the history of perfumery, and especially in the oriental genre. That\'s why I\'m always so delighted to find novel iterations of it, whether it be the aforementioned OSM or Guerlain\'s Encens Mythique. Beyond Rose succeeds in carving out a niche for itself thanks to a few clever touches on the part of the (unknown?) perfumer. First, this is not a very ""green"" rose in the traditional sense, like, for instance, that of Nahema or Joy. The dew, sap, and stem have been replaced with the drier, earthier, grassier maté, as well as the beautifully lactonic-sour osmanthus. Already, we are moving ""beyond"" rose in its botanical sense and into something more abstract, something resembling a rose but whose chlorophyllic green has been transformed into a painterly, otherworldly mix of greens, both wet-vibrant (osmanthus) and dry-reserved (maté). The freesia (a note which can be very artificial and cloying if overused) is the bridge between the greens and the rose itself, returning some sweet green-white floralcy that melds seamlessly into the rich red petals of the flower. I don\'t get any heavy amber or medicinal oud; rather, we have a trio of gentle balsams: soft, fuzzy, benzoin; warm, almost leathery labdanum (one of my favorite notes); and drier, sharper styrax. I personally don\'t detect any pepper, but that may be just me or my bottle. \n\nAltogether, a marvelous perfume, cheerful yet elegant, a modern take on an ancient flower. I also find Beyond Rose to be incredibly versatile in terms of season and time of day; there are enough cool notes to balance out the base, so I wear it year around. The bottle is gorgeous. Hopefully Clinique revives this beauty!', 'purplesun09/12/20 09:56Beyond Rose is an innovative, quite unique and modern rose fragrance the quality of which matches the brand image of Clinique.\nI have never smelled a rose like what you have in Beyond Rose before. Mind you, this rose is not baroque and opulent like some other examples out there, like Nahema or Rouge, which I can compare, based on my collection. She is modern, refined and borderline minimalistic, just not yet clean, which roses can hardly ever be. All the balsamic notes in the pyramid make the difference in impression, which is very rich and luxurious.\nThis kind of rose is work-friendly, as it doesn’t oppress the wearer or their surroundings. I got asked once in an astonished tone of voice “What perfume is it that you are wearing?”. I didn’t answer, I just let the person asking wonder what on earth it might be, which she would have never found out, as practically no one wears fragrances in my country.\nBeyond Rose is quite a unique rose that has disappeared from online outlets, being a limited-release creation, probably designed for the Arabian market. The patterns on the box and on the bottle, as well as the quality of the composition reveal that this isn’t a mass market fragrance, just an artistic feat made for connoisseurs and highly collectible. I don’t really get some of the disappointed comments one can read here for a delightful perfume as this one.\nIf you want to project some big-city allure, like you are a man or woman of the world, without actually someone suspecting, then you might want to launch a hunt for this veritable treasure. Think big city lights, glass and steel and carefree strolls on autumn weekends on some of the most expensive streets, just admiring the window displays and soaking up some glamour, if you are that vain. Otherwise, wear at any moment you like. You can’t go wrong with Beyond Rose.', ""MsLittlejohn07/17/20 17:11This is so pretty. I'd never tried any Clinique fragrances, but I received a generous sample of it in a trade. It was the first one to go on my wants out of all of the other samples! 😊 It's a lovely tea rose and balsam just as the Fragrantican below me says. Unique indeed. I've been trying to find a simple rose scent for a long time and this one is the only one I've sworn to purchase, not hope for a trade for. Clean - and just plain pretty after a shower.

Unfortunately, I found it to be like too much turkish delight, quickly sickly.', 'mychinarose05/25/20 17:12Okay, I finally ""get"" this fragrance. And I love it. I blind-bought this a couple of years ago and immediately regretted it, and thought about off-loading it. My nose just wasn\'t up to this type of exotic concoction at the time. But now, this is reminding me of a ""fresher"" version of Lancome Oud Bouquet... minus the oud, of course. Beyond Rose has got its own woodiness, possibly from the styrax/white pepper/mate mix. I\'m also really intrigued by the osmanthus note. For sweetness, instead of praline this has the vanilla/benzoin/amber, which work together to give it a rich sweetness. And then of course, the rose and rose oil accords. This is truly beautiful, and an all year round wear...unlike Oud Bouquet, which I would wear either only in cold months during the day, or for sultry nights out in warmer months. I\'m glad I gave this another go!\n\nEDIT: I just got an Oil Perfumery dupe of Portrait of a Lady, and it smells really super similar to Clinique Beyond Rose. Not sure if the original does or not, but it\'s something I\'m going to research more!', ""Throughthelookingglass05/14/20 03:15Beyond Rose is elegant and rich, developing into a warm rose with hints of turkish delight. Don't judge a book by its cover, the opening smells like an expensive pharmacy. I would have walked away if I had sprayed it on a card instore. Luckily this was a blind buy.

All round elegance, just give her a few minutes to get there."", ""harperhilton04/09/20 17:14i do like this, but i like lauder's calligraphy rose better. they are much along the same lines to my nose, with this BR being clearer, dryer airier and CR being denser, chewier, and rounder. but they are both perfectly good rose perfumes in the arabic style. (would be interesting to know if it was the same nose for both?)"", ""bel.gravia04/09/20 15:43At the moment the only heavier, smokier perfume I own is vintage Chanel No. 5. I no longer own Opium nor L'Agent.... \nBeyond Rose - what a beauty! It is a sultry blooming rose with spicies, green tea matcha and smoky dark deep balsams. Perfect. Although for spring L'Imperatrice is a little bit of a better choice because of its lightness and fruitness, Beyond Rose has the top. It definitely has that Middle Eastern vibe as well. Beyond Rose means two things: first, right from the start there is a huge exotic rose in full bloom, second, underneath it, beyond it, behind it there are precious golden balsams, warm, spicy and intoxicating. The concentration is Parfum as well, so this perfume is definitely worth the price."", ""juniemoon03/17/20 11:26Wow, where do i start. I've had this for almost three years now. To be honest, it was fifty/fifty buying it between the mostly good reviews and the $40 price tag. I did not get a chance to test it first.\n\nI was aware there was a bit of oud, which tbh, made me a little nervous. When I first sprayed it, I thought oh, no, medicinal. I don't think I like this very much. That day was the only day I wore it and put it away, to pretty much forget about it.\n\nUntil last week. I'm on a verrryy slow buy this year, going through forgotten purchases. Digging this out, I remembered reading here that sometimes a fragrance stored will improve with age. Hoping that would happen here, happily it seems to be so with Beyond Rose. The rose exudes a maturity and depth, with the oud only being a soft whisper. I love how the rose bloomed to a dark sweetness. This is not overwhelming in sillage or longevity but performs quite satisfactorily.\n\nIt's slowly growing towards love. Glad I gave her another chance."", 'Peggymlb10/31/19 21:41This is my first review on Fragrantica and I very much enjoy reading all the reviews on this sight.

The few lamps in the tent glow as the Persian rugs cover the ground, the seating, the insides of the tent, and the ceiling...What a trip for the senses!

Clinique, what happened??"", 'corkscrewcurly06/16/18 08:04Testing from an official 10ml bottle kindly sent me by Ioli19 (thank you!). \n\nI am ambivalent about rose dominant perfumes. If the rose isn\'t done right it can smell really sharp, dusty, cheap and unpleasant to me.\n\nMy initial reaction on first spraying Beyond Rose was ""Meh"". I wish there was an emoticon to express that ""Meh"" reaction we\'ve all experienced when smelling a perfume at some time or other. It\'s not an active dislike - but I have to mark it as one, otherwise it would be in the same category as many perfumes that I like but don\'t love. \n\nThe rose juuuuuuusst teeters on the edge of making me recoil and scrub... but then the other notes pull it back into line. \n\nI am not that familiar with Clinique; I have only three perfumes, two of which I adore (Aromatics Black and Black Cherry - I cannot abide the original Elixir, although I feel as if I should love it) and Calyx so I can\'t really assess whether Beyond Rose is a typical offering. \n\nIn common with many other reviewers I am picking up on oud, but this is very VERY smooth and subtle; Beyond Rose smells as if it could have been produced by one of the more expensive Arab houses. \n\nTo me this is a pink, herby rose, with a hint of spice. There\'s a familiarity to this which I was trying to pin down and it wasn\'t until I read highonfumes review below that I realised s/he\'d nailed it - it also reminds me of ""Turkish Delight"" after about an hour, but neatly avoids becoming a sugary, syrupy mess. Whilst I don\'t subscribe to gender assignation in perfumery, I feel this leans feminine. \n\nIt\'s a mild June day, so I\'m quite warm, but I think this could be an all-season perfume. \n\nWhilst I don\'t love this enough to buy a bottle for myself (I already have a rose perfume which I adore - Wisal Al Ahaba by Ard Al Zaafaran, which is THE most glorious rose I have ever smelled and is ridiculously inexpensive), but I would be very happy to receive Beyond Rose as a gift.\n\nSillage is close, but this is a long-lasting perfume, even on my skin.\n\nVery lovely and I\'d say it\'s a safe blind buy.\n\nETA. I think this is niche quality at designer price. It seriously is THAT good.\n\nEdited again to add: I bought a bottle. I love this.', ""courant05/07/18 01:50The oud is there, a touch of saffron, and ginger. The ginger is similar to that in Twily by Christine Nagel, but it's rose, not tuberose, that it is understudy to.\nThere might be a bit of cumin in this, or perhaps it's the saffron, but I think a man could wear this easily; it's more masculine than I was expecting. Highly unusual, I guess that's what has garnered comparisons to Juliette and Montale. \nThis isn't rose by Goutal, or Nahema by Guerlain, it's very mysterious compared to Sa Majeste by Lutens. It's just in a bubble of its own. Well done, but no summer time fragrance, this is winter in a hothouse, Morticia Addams style."", 'Annabear04/20/18 20:46I don’t use Clinique products and haven’t bought one of their fragrances since Aromatics Elixir back in the early 90’s. If I hadn’t known this was a Clinique fragrance, I would have guessed it was a Montale. It reminds me very much of their Oud fragrances with a bold and spicy rose, and lasts equally as well. This is a remarkable creation by Clinique, a far cry from their generic “Happy” scents.\nIt was a blind buy and I would rate it as a high 9.5 out of 10 in the blind buy success category.', 'Planet_X03/09/18 12:12Can not believe this charismatic juice haven\'t received an army of admirers just yet!\n\nIt is same good as Calligraphy Rose of Aramis by quality, has very Eastern spiced-woody-oudy aspect, a little trace of JHG\'s DNA from Midnight Oud as well, yet still keeping its own charm and elegance.\nI was smitten by it from first minutes, such a moreish fragrance, and frankly speaking I DO smell ""oud"" in it, even though very refined ""oud"" and very polished. Not really peppery to my nose, as described, but resinous-ambery rich rose. I definitely recommend it to ppl, who, like myself, appreciate Rose, oud, amber and woods and for whom there is no such thing as ""too many roses and woods on the market"". \nWell done, Clinique, at last well done.', 'highonfumes12/27/17 19:37I...love this perfume. I received it yesterday- a blind buy. Rose can go wrong in perfume in a few different ways. It can be artificial smelling, “old”, musty, sharp. Beyond rose doesn’t make these mistakes. The rose has two definite presences here: one layers smells like the dark red Don Juan roses I grow, and the other smells like Turkish delight. Somehow the jellied sensation of the candy is even present. Wearing BR is like...sitting in a cozy room with a hot cup of Assam (not maté, Assam has a fruity note, maybe the influence of osmanthus here) black tea on an agarwood table. The table has a bouquet of fresh roses and Turkish delight on a plate. There is very smooth unlit resin hanging in the air.\n\nJust prior to receiving the bottle, I read a review on “mimifroufrou” that said this: “The rose note, pleasant and round at first, fast dissolves into a black sea of unrelenting fossil oil-smelling oud for whoever like their steack(sic) burnt, their wine extra dry and their 90% dark chocolate to be oh-so bitterly pleasurable.” Clove and carnation are mentioned as olfactive analogues to this perfume, and I disagree with that as well as the above statement about the intensity of the oud.\n\nThe review referenced above speaks a lot to this perfume’s appeal to the western market, with eastern influence... I live in a metropolitan southern American city. I have never set foot in the Middle East. I understand the delineation presented here, but I don’t relate to it. This perfume doesn’t feel alien to me at all, nor does it feel harsh or extreme.\n\nBR lasted the entirety of my nine hour workday. There was a two stage development. The latter half of development highlights the osmanthus above the rose. Suitable for 3/4 seasons omitting only (perhaps), the thick humid summer where I live. Unisex, steps back an forth over lines of masculine and feminine during development. Contemporary, not dated at all, but still familiar. \n\nFinal summary: total beauty AND affordable. Love, love, love.', 'florabella09/29/17 13:20I just picked this fragrance up at Winners, so glad to have found it! This is a gorgeous spicy rose scent. I find that it is perfect for the cooler days of Autum and I am looking forward to getting loads of wear out of it this winter. \nThe Rose is somewhat vintage to my nose and oud is discreet, just enough to keep it from being too sweet. The amber and spices add warmth and depth, perfect for cooler weather. \nEven though it was a bit pricier than what I usually spend on my perfumes, I have no regrets. This beauty could become a contender for my ""desert island"" scent! It\'s lovely!!', 'Nataliemarie06/06/17 19:19To my nose, on my skin, this is nothing like Noir de Noir. That is one of my HG\'s. This is a lighter, rosier, slightly powdery/soapy perfume. I think the Rose/Pepper/Osmanthus combo is what ppl are reading as ""Oud"". If you ever smelled Al Rehab\'s STRONG Oud Attars, you would be able to tell the difference. A few of those are so strong I cant even scrub them off. This, in comparison, is light. One spray is too powdery, so I have to put 3 on my skin, in the same spot & oddly enough, it builds it to a different level. A better one. Not very long lasting IMO for the price & def very different for Clinique. Not sure why it costs so much, I understand oils being expensive when it comes to certain flowers, but I did expect more. Stays very close to my skin & after a few hours, I cant smell it anymore. Maybe others can. If you like powdery rose perfumes, you will like it. I wish the powder scent didnt stand out to me so much.\nUpdate~ I sprayed this on at 10 pm, at 6AM I was catching slight wafts of that oldish powdery smell, & that\'s all. I just recieved this yesterday. I have Full Bottle in box (except for what I sprayed last night) $50 Free Shipped in the US if anyone is interested. It was a sealed box as well. I am not into powdery at all.', 'Parfumista201003/19/17 13:49@modernmabuse : I own both Noir de Noir and Beyond Rose. No direct comparison of these adviseable.

Both are beautiful in their own way but by no means similar other than the genre they originate from, IMHO.', 'modernmabuse03/19/17 11:57Is Beyond Rose a clone of Tom Ford Noir de Noir?', ""flowers-in-the-springtime01/20/17 04:32Beyond Rose took me by surprise. I'm not a great fan of anything Clinique, both in perfumes or skincare, but this perfume is in a league all of it's own and I am baffled as to how they managed to produce such a heady beauty as this.\nThe top notes hit me with a sharp and powerful spiciness which comes across as utterly masculine. The amber is raw and unforgiving, as is the pepper and I am drawn to thinking of the Mancera line of Roses Vanilla and Roses Greedy. Also CD Amber Nuit comes to my mind. What I'm trying to say is that this is anything but an innocuous mainstream rose perfume. This is high up there among the best niche brands for that WOW factor!\nI don't like the top notes, they are sharp and screechy to my nose but thankfully the heart notes come into play very quickly and all of a sudden this fragrance is now soft and floral with a hint of oudh, (yes I think there is some in there). This perfume now is starting to behave, the composition of notes are much tamer, they are doing what all great perfumes do, they are shifting around and the notes are changing constantly. The pepper has taken a back seat to the florals and the amber is now much quieter, the perfume is now sweeter, more feminine (although this is absolutely unisex to my nose) and doesn't scream at you. \nA wonderful blend of quality ingredients which have been superbly created and have produced class in a bottle. Well done Clinique! Amazing perfume!"", ""freddinos01/15/17 13:36A clean rose, but not soapy or bright-summery. Beyond rose may have some oud in its composition and, if it does, it is a sterile, sanitized one. Inhaling deeply I have the feeling of an unnatural perfume, chemical perhaps but in an avant garde way, similar to Mugler's 'non human' jasmine accord.\nThe whole concept is very much in line with Clinique as a brand, with its minimalistic, clinical facade, clarifying lotions, seven day scrubs and discreet make up shades; think oud and rose born and raised on Upper East Side.\nBeyond Rose is beautiful in its own way, and really, I can imagine it being appropriate for evenings out in dimly lit hotel bars,perhaps the ones overlooking Central Park in NYC, where expensive cocktails are served to impeccably groomed ladies.

Wearing BR is like...sitting in a cozy room with a hot cup of Assam (not maté, Assam has a fruity note, maybe the influence of osmanthus here) black tea on an agarwood table. The table has a bouquet of fresh roses and Turkish delight on a plate. There is very smooth unlit resin hanging in the air.\n\nJust prior to receiving the bottle, I read a review on “mimifroufrou” that said this: “The rose note, pleasant and round at first, fast dissolves into a black sea of unrelenting fossil oil-smelling oud for whoever like their steack(sic) burnt, their wine extra dry and their 90% dark chocolate to be oh-so bitterly pleasurable.” Clove and carnation are mentioned as olfactive analogues to this perfume, and I disagree with that as well as the above statement about the intensity of the oud.\n\nThe review referenced above speaks a lot to this perfume’s appeal to the western market, with eastern influence... I live in a metropolitan southern American city. I have never set foot in the Middle East. I understand the delineation presented here, but I don’t relate to it. This perfume doesn’t feel alien to me at all, nor does it feel harsh or extreme.\n\nBR lasted the entirety of my nine hour workday. There was a two stage development. The latter half of development highlights the osmanthus above the rose. Suitable for 3/4 seasons omitting only (perhaps), the thick humid summer where I live. Unisex, steps back an forth over lines of masculine and feminine during development. Contemporary, not dated at all, but still familiar. \n\nFinal summary: total beauty AND affordable. Love, love, love.', ""lairderien10/18/14 16:15Where is the rose?? All I get is smoky incense...period. No pepper, no cinammon, & certainly no rose (unless you inhale your skin deeply) - just a deep, smoky amber. I've been wearing this all week hoping that the scent changes or that I'll grow to love it, but I fear its not going to happen as on me this is more masculine than feminine. Fans of Arabian, smoky oud scents will love this & its certainly a big change in style from the normal Clinique offerings. I also managed to sample Penhaligons Levantium this week & the two fragrances are very similar."", ""Musky408/25/15 14:06When I sprayed this on the back of my hand, all I got was a very strong and very unpleasant antiseptic smell. This didn't change or develop into anything more bearable and I just couldn't wait to wash it off."", ""Amandini04/06/21 04:11Really dont understand this, I really wanted this. I'm always looking always for the perfect Rose perfume. This isnt it. It smells exactly like that thick orange iodine that they paint on you when you go into operating theatre for an operation. Exactly like that when you spray it on.... Then it mellows down to a thin monosylable turkish delight. Theres no intensity, it lasts max 30 mins until it entirely disappears. Huge disappointment. I bought three 15 ml samples they are all the same. Glad I didnt stump for the full bottle, couldnt find one that wasnt ridiculously priced. Thats unusual for me as I usually buy blind and buy 100ml bottles. Only twice have I been disappointed out of 40. This is a waster of money. It was made for the wealthy Arabic market who shop at Harrods were it was sold.. NO ROSE.. So in that sense the name is accurate, its BEYOND ROSE.... Sad as I had such high hopes. I wore Clinique AE as my signature scent for many years.. If you want to test this I can send you a sample if you DM me."", 'PolishRose07/03/20 11:31I bought this on the strength of reviews promising a stunning rose. Unfortunately, I found it to be like too much turkish delight, quickly sickly.']"

Vote for Ingredients","['DracheMitch01/14/23 11:16I’ve seen reviews saying that no one would ever revive a fragrance profile like this, but that’s exactly what Replica did with “At the Barber”.\n\nChemistry does EXACTLY smell like a man in the 90’s. Not a teen like Ck One, but a man. It’s the classic smell of aftershave with mint and lavender. Not everyone wants to smell like a humidor or the bottom of the ocean, which seems to be the only options afforded to men these days. This was the perfect fragrance for a man wanting to smell clean, fresh, and quietly confident. It’s a shame Clinique discontinued it because it’s much better than At the Barber.', ""stu197408/01/22 11:08I loved this in the 90s when gifted a bottle: this, Armani and Minataur were my impossibly chic fragrance wardrobe at university. I just had to find bottle - and now its discontinued it was a very expensive itch to scratch. But I'm glad I did. Is it unique? No. Is it deep and weird and strange? No. Is it fresh and evocative of a place and time? Yes."", ""Chet5601/14/22 07:53Dated by some standards, Chemistry by Clinique remains my favorite of the clean, fresh, sporty fragrances that achieved zenith in the mid-1990s. Others that come to my mind's nose are Polo Sport, Tommy by Tommy Hilfiger, and Fathom. It evokes a sense of wellness, fitness, and vigor - something one would wear when going out for a good run, bike ride, or inline skating session, then spray on afterward to continue the feeling. My last bottle is just below the halfway mark and while I'll hate to see it go, as surely it will, it will have been an enjoyable aromatic companion across some wonderful years."", 'Dangler8310/29/21 09:10I was gifted a bottle of this stuff. I never like it from the start. Strong, heavy and gave me a headache as soon as it hit my nose. It sat on the shelf for years. I know some older fragrances are timeless, this is dated to me. I ended up using it as a bathroom spray.', 'alphairone09/14/21 06:19It would be unfair to reduce Clinique Chemistry to 90s nostalgia, though it does bring me back to that time when a clean, aromatic musky fragrance was de rigueur for fashionable young men of that time. Chemistry bring me to my very first days entering gay clubs as a bi kid, just 18, exploring my sexuality with a guy that I befriended at the time. We visited Qwest in Boston, it must\'ve been 1997. The men smelled like this or CK One, but while the latter sort of has associations of the not so great feelings of late adolescence, this one makes me feel wistful and brings a smile to my face.\n\nChemistry is like just having had a dip in a chlorinated pool (don\'t let that put you off, there isn\'t a ""chlorine"" smell per se), the showering with a nice soap and using freshly laundered white towels. There is this feeling of cleanness and clarity that so few fragrances that attempt this effect achieve with success. The notes that stand out most is this bright, fresh ginger root mingling with coriander and mint, with neroli further imparting this fresh laundry, clean skin quality. It also reminds me of the way dryer sheets smelled back then (none on the market smell that way any longer). A dollop of laundry musks in the dry down is what really fixes the whole composition together, lasting on clothes for an eternity and on the skin for quite some time, given the nature of Chemistry. \n\nFor someone who is such a fan of the rich, resinous, incensed, and complex, I am amused of my affinity for this (and for Aramis New West), as I do not gravitate towards the ""so fresh and so clean"" or aquatic when it comes to fragrance. But Chemistry is just so well composed and presents this experience without any rough edges. It\'s a wonderful palate cleanser, with cheer and sunniness. Sometimes I really just need something as simple and straightforward as that. It\'s unfortunate that it has long been discontinued while far inferior scents from that time period prevail in neutered form.', 'ColMcr7803/17/21 15:10I have to agree with the review from Joey G about a slight weird smell of Bombay mix coming from my latest bottle of chemistry. Not pleasant.\nI have had numerous bottles of this over a 25 year period and always loved it for a clean daytime freshy. It was always a re-buy favourite but I won’t buy or wear again now.', 'aet03/16/20 07:54definitely a child of the 90s, but works for today. Light, gingery with a muted floral undercurrent. a safe, pleasant fragrance for daytime and the office. Has a clean vibe that some will read as bland. longevity good. sillage ok. not much to offend here.', ""Filosykos03/29/19 05:57I've bought 3-4 bottles over the years.\nI do think it's a copy of Eternity, but even though Eternity may have come first, I think Chemistry is of a higher quality. \nIt smells more natural. And because Clinique doesn't use allergens I wouldn't be surprised if this is composed of natural ingredients.\nThe ginger in Chemistry is wonderful.\nYou can't go wrong with Chemistry,it just smells fantastic. \nAnd I love the pharmacy style bottle.\nIt's being discontinued so grab a bottle before it's gone.\n(It's miles better than happy)."", ""Robinfv01/28/19 06:19Being a big Clinique skincare fan, and hopelessly devoted to Aramis 900, the male version of Aromatics Elixer, I had such high hopes when this was first launched in the nineties. I could not believe what I smelled back then for the first time: flat, anonymous roomspray. I've tried it many times when I found a tester, just couldn't believe my favourite brand came with something so bland. Finally I lost track. Then, I came upon it on sale at a local drugstore in 2018: for only E 13 for a 100 ml spray, use it for what I thought it was, an expensive roomspray. Well, I don't know if it has been reformulated, or that my nose has changed the past decades, but what a beautiful sophisticated scent this is. Fresh, classy, green with a twist. Super masculine, office safe, long-lasting, just beautiful. Could have been my new signature scent at last. So sad (now) that is has been discontinued. Forgive me Clinique, my fault for 24 years."", ""jlmcgrot10/17/18 12:28I have an original mid-90's bottle that was probably purchased not too long after it was launched. My dad passed it on to me since this was a gift from my mom and was not really his style (He was a PS Paul Sebastian guy). For this fresh and clean style of fragrance, it is very long lasting. I still have about 1/2 a bottle. This juice was never brown, as someone else mentioned. It has always been a very light yellow/clear."", ""Fendy109/08/18 17:52A highly refined classy scent that has an almost invisible smokey-like presence - perhaps similar to the effect of the ISO E Super ingredient style of fragrances. I think it works off body heat to become more incensey and noticeable, but it accompanies and complements your presence like a shadow. I would buy this if it wasn't so overpriced, but a highly overlooked fragrance that is not so easy to find. Definitely worth checking out in my opinion!"", ""Zipsync09/03/18 10:04It's supposed to be for men but I wear ii so I would say it could be a unisex scent. Spraying on clothing, I could still smell it on my clothing after 8 hours. On skin, barely smell it after 30 minutes. That's just me though. It smells so clean!"", ""Joey G06/17/18 10:12I must have tried a dud bottle in Boots. This absolutely stank of urinal soap and bombay mix. The most disgusting thing I've ever sprayed from a fragrance bottle."", ""ScentJunkie61602/01/18 14:02It's metallic and citrusy. It's citrus juice staining your old carbon steel knives. It's somewhere in no man's land between the powerhouse 80's and 90's fragrances and the much more subtle fragrances of this century. This fact probably is the reason why this fragrance never broke out into the masses. But the fact that this one is well done has kept it on the shelves. Longevity and projection are good. Those who want to be subtle and those who want their fragrances to make an announcement will both be disappointed with this one. Not sure this fragrance's history with being pulled off the shelves or discontinued but it's been readily available at Clinique online for years. I don't use it often. But every time I do give it another try, I say to myself: this is too good for me to use it so infrequently."", 'trevorrobertlee12/03/17 18:49This reminds me so much of Big Pony 3 by Polo! This however, is much more adult-like whereas Big Pony 3 is very youthful and preppy.', ""Timby09/21/17 11:06I did not give this frangrance as much time before judging as I usually do, simply because it wss not long lasting.\n\nAside from not being long lasting, I don't care for it.\n\nNuff said."", 'CGV08/15/17 07:41A great quality blend with a fine, stand alone aroma! I love it on fall and spring days. Comforting and reliable, like a good friend. Stood the test of time and has a fantastic performance as well! Pure class!', 'Robwiz12/22/16 09:16I gave this a try and the initial hit is gingery and citrus, which dries down pretty quickly to a skin scent that reminds me of celery and linen cupboards. Projection and longevity seemed fairly poor. There are so many better fragrances available.', ""dogmeat06/15/16 20:40Right out of the bottle, I get a strong, minty, spicy citrus. As it dries down, it becomes musky and woodsy, but remains clean and soap-like. But, it is not the same kind of soapy as Gendarme or Acqua di Parma. It's much more brisk and masculine to my nose. Unlike a lot of newer soap-like scents, I get an old-school barbershop vibe from this one. Initially, I didn't care too much for this scent, but I have come to like it very much. It's clean and easy-to-wear but with enough spice to make it different."", ""Grottola04/01/14 10:23Chemistry is actually a pretty decent late 80's/early 90's fresh fougere along the lines of Calvin Klein Escape for Men or Aramis New West. Also it's unbelievably strong and tenacious on my skin - and this is just from the current version! I can only imagine how bombastic the vintage stuff is. Worth trying!"", ""AND-MAT03/12/14 09:56We just recieved a shipment of goods from Estee lauder and Co.

Well... a skin scent. So subtle and so gentle you won't feel it on you without putting your nose into it. That's aside it is fairly long lasting... You get easily a 6+ hours from it.\n\nIt starts out with a lemony minty fragrance before turning into a musky spicy aroma which was completely unexpected... I thought it would remain citrussy and fresh... The drydown is soapy and very clean. \n\nAll in all... It's not bad but not my cup of tea... The main problem for me is it's weakness and blandness!

Discontinued by Clinique","['Tigreza03/03/23 18:01Hello! I’m new to all the frag language - can anyone tell me what this last note is in Wrappings that lasts forever - I experience it as a thin metal pendulum plunged down into an unfathomable well, all the way to the center of the earth, which is no longer earth .. you KNOW what I’m talking about!\nWhat is this??', 'ooolgooo02/09/23 04:01For some Wrappings relates to Christmass, for me its this time of the year in Europe, still frost, but the days are longer, the birds are loud, the air is clear. Nothing articulates more the hope of spring than Wrappings. So well blended, natural, uplifting. AE is too heavy for me, and I am too young to know chypres first hand, but I can wear this easily. I wish Clinique continues to issue this beauty for the holidays.', ""perfumecheck06/02/22 02:26Classy unique sparkling green scent with some metallic and electric effects.. very addictive\n\nShame that it's been discontinued.. this is a masterpiece in every way."", 'Chrissypack06/01/22 12:12An exquisitely beautiful and complex fragrance. A green floral chypre. Absolutely gorgeous.', 'alphairone05/06/22 07:45A fascinating crossroads between the 70s green chypre and the ozonic, clean aquatics of the 90s, Wrappings opens with coniferous aldehydes and a cool breeze on seaside samphire and juniper. I hear arpeggiated chords in my head as the scene pans across pine trees in mist, sort of like ""Hanging Garden Transfer"" by Michael Hoenig (give it a listen!).\n\nThis effervescence hovers over sharp, pungent mosses and thujonic (minty, cedar-leafy, sage-like, camphorous) wormwood and the florals, while present, take second fiddle, occasionally whispering a delicate refrain. ""Hello, over here..."" but the less pretty things are deserving of love and assert themselves through the heart of Wrappings. They do seem to leave some room for what I detect as geranium however. The essential oil after all comes from its leaves and not its flowers. The coniferous accord persists, but gets warmer, more cedary than ""needle-y"" over time. \n\nA few hours in, the sillage persists but now the predominant notes are vaguely smoky cedar and balsam fir that eclipse whatever traces of leafy, herbal green that preceded it. The aquatic feel still comes through even as it is enveloped in a swath of warm musk. \n\nWrappings has only been sold during the holiday season for several years but is still in production it seems. I would recommend this to those who appreciate Aliage, Devin, Private Collection, even Calyx or New West. However, it really stands alone as a composition and I find it a delight to wear.\xa0\n\nWrappings has only been sold during the holiday season for several years but is still in production it seems.

However, it really stands alone as a composition and I find it a delight to wear.', ""Elsee04/06/22 07:50I am a perfume collector and really thought this would be awesome based on the good reviews. I actually love Happy but can't wear it. I can wear AE but in small doses. I have the AE collector with the blotter. It takes a unique process to wear. Sadly, Wrappings is....ugh. \n\nIt does not smell good straight from the bottle. I sprayed it on a tissue and let it tone down before I put it on. (That is my AE process) Nope. Not a dupe to anything I own AND I can't wash it off. Pretty good staying power! This needs to blend into someone's chemistry for sure. In my lab, the chemistry doesn't work -- sadly. I can see the potential here however. I may keep trying to invent a combination with this, but for now, I think it goes back in the box and in the collector stash until colder weather. Sorry for the 'not so good' review, but remember -- everyone is unique!\n\nHappy Spring everyone!!\n\n\nQUICK UPDATE after an hour of wear: As I stated, it does not wash off, HOWEVER, after an hour, it isn't that terrible. But after an hour? EEKS! :)"", ""SadieBluesLady03/21/22 13:35What a fantastic green spring fragrance!!! I now have 2 bottles, I'm guessing one is older only because it's more amber colored than the other. They are slightly different, the darker one isn't as strong nor does it last as long as the other. \nOh poor me! (hehehehehe)"", ""LOST_HORIZON01/11/22 14:08Wappings makes me think that it's never too late for love. It is a very crystalline and clean green perfume. I sit in a garden with many statues with moss, wet from the rain ...\nIt is so beautiful and so perfect, it is a perfume that always surpasses reality ..."", ""justcheckinout01/05/22 16:17They didn't release Wrappings this past holiday season :( I shoulda bought it last year"", ""srhunt11/18/21 09:01I'm so sorry Laura Palmer. I'm so so sorry."", ""faustbanana11/09/21 16:27On an eternal hunt for green scents, I stumbled on Wrappings. It is... very green! One of the sweeter, headier greens I've tried. Nothing very astringent or cold about this. The floral, nutmeg and cedar notes make it a warm green, a rare treat IMO. Perhaps I'm overplaying my own connotations when it comes to Clinique, but my first impression was that this is an outstanding '90s department store scent - it has the air of a well-to-do, well put-together 30s-ish woman. Pleasant and feminine, deliciously clean and fresh but with a eyebrow-raising spicy note. I'd definitely inquire as to what this was if I smelled it in the wild. A pleasant surprise!\n\nThe longevity is INSANE. I sprayed twice 24 hours ago and am still getting whiffs from my wrist."", 'Intrepid-Taste-111110/22/21 14:22now listen, I do not advise blind buying this scent; however, that’s exactly what I did. I ordered the gift set from Harrod’s online, since it appears that’s the only reliable source for it, and wow is this stuff bonkers. honestly, Clinique fragrances are so underrated for how wild they are.\n\nthis is such a wet, cold, dank green scent, like a dark wooded forest overgrown with ivy and moss and possibly the supernatural. after living with it for a while this morning I realized this must be what The Green Knight’s chapel smelled like when Gawain finally arrived to uphold his end of the bargain. I’m extremely into it, it’s so witchy. wear it for Halloween, wear it for Christmas, and remember not to get carried away if challenged to a New Year’s Game ;)', 'patricia.w.lancaster08/24/21 14:27Fresh, lovely and aromatic. I wish I could wear this, but the artemisia is translated to a vomit note by my nose, so no can', 'evelynave06/12/21 09:02The most recent version of wrappings I have dates back about five years ago. It has the brilliant frosty brightness of Chanel No. 22, a kind of glare that would make you squint outdoors. It smells of cypress and first-to-spring-up florals under even fresher sheets of splintering ice.\n\nThe 1990 original involved a much lighter jacket. It was brisk; more in-between seasonally. The light was more afternoon sun, and the snow was starting to melt and drip from the tree branches. Saps and resins were a crucial part of that effect. This steered the fragrance closer to the more-chilly-than-cold evergreen climate of Bill Blass and Private Collection. It’s unlikely anyone would have drawn comparisons between the original Wrappings and No. 22; the relationship to Aromatics Elixir was far deeper then than now.\n\nAromatics Elixir was almost twenty years old when Wrappings first came out; whereas the oceanic craze was just cresting. Escape came out the year after Wrappings, and it’s interesting to think of Wrappings as a bridge between old and new; Clinique trying to keep up with the market at the time. Wrappings transplants its water from the beach to the foliage of the great outdoors.\n\nBoth bottles of Wrappings I have, old and far less old, are worth having, like slightly different flankers of each other. There aren’t very many scents that capture the emotional experience of climate and place this specifically. Wrappings puts you inside a scene you animate with memory and imaginative longing. The older version for me is a certain kind of afternoon in my Midwest adolescence—at the far end of an oppressive, shut-in winter, when the trees and nature are first gasping back to life, warmed awake by the sun. The newer version is the morning after a third or fourth heavy snow, a vista of white and the blinding sun it amplifies in every direction, a sense of being out in the wide open but bundled up to hold your own in it.', ""Carpe Noctem04/24/21 04:17I'm looking for excuses not to go to bed and thanks to Massimilianoinquieto I found another one! \nHere is massi milano in quieto review translated:\n\nThis magnificent perfume that I used in 1993 and still use it from time to time reminds me of a Mediterranean landscape where the mountains drop sheer to the sea and the vegetation has exactly these smells.\nThe sea, the sky, the green of the herbs, the flowers, the warm sun, the radiant and invigorating atmosphere are enclosed in this little perfume.\nA light spray is enough and expands like a cloud and lasts all day.\nThe 90s versions are the best. I have a recent one but it is too cold and rarefied and does not contain all the burning and deep riches."", ""massimilianoinquieto04/24/21 03:37Questo magnifico profumo che ho usato nel 1993 e ancora adesso lo uso ogni tanto,mi ricorda un paesaggio mediterraneo dove le montagne scendono a picco sul mare e la vegetazione ha esattamente questi odori.\nIl mare, il cielo, il verde delle erbe, i fiori, il sole caldo, l'atmosfera radiosa e rinvigorente sono racchiuse in questo piccolo profumo.\nNe basta un leggero spruzzo che si espande come una nuvola e dura tutto il giorno.\nLe versioni anni 90 sono le migliori. Ne ho una recente ma è troppo fredda e rarefatta e non contiene tutte le ricchezze ardenti e profonde."", 'brvndxn04/22/21 23:05This one is unusual and perfect for spring time!', 's2jkbrad02/18/21 10:03I have no idea what to make of this one. I have aromatics the original and the one in black, so I thought I would be fine blind buying this. It is different. It smells like pine to me. I’m still trying to get used to it. I don’t know what to think about it yet.', 'elegantshnozzie02/03/21 07:16A quick sniff out of the bottle... putrid urine. Initial blast onto a note card... more urine with a load of damp heavy moss and pine.\n|||||| Give this one time.\nAfter a couple of minutes, you get a whiff of the sea breeze and a fresh ozonic pine forest. I do not typically like aquatic scents, but this one is aquatic in the sense of water and snow saturated pine needles and forest floor. It dries down to a beautiful TRUE spicy green fragrance. This is what I wanted aromatics elixir to be. There is a sweetness from the pine that softens the damp moss and floats on a breeze of fresh frigid air. I imagine wearing this on a cross-country road trip, thrown in a backpack and trudging through hiking spots.', ""fire2heart01/06/21 15:09I first bought this almost 3 years ago. It was a blind buy. I already own vintage and current formulations of Aromatics Elixir and I knew that this is similar but different and that it would be herbal and dry.\n\nIt's a complicated scent, to me. It's dry and herbal, definitely leans towards masculine, which I like. I get white sage and pine or fir trees, even though neither are listed here. Sage is listed on the Clinique website.\n\nIt initially starts out strong but it quickly calms down to almost a skin scent on me. I can wear it around my husband and he does not comment, which is a good thing! It's taken him 15 years to accept the fact that I am a perfume lover and I'm going to wear it. I will stay away from certain ones that he really hates. \n\nIt's definitely a cold weather scent.\nI just bought another perfume set since it's half price on Clinique's website right now. Yay!!"", 'BerryRose12/12/20 11:38Wrappings is 30 years old this year, and though in some ways it’s very 90s it’s one of those perfumes that feels timeless. I love that they have kept the original bottle design, though it’s now only sold in very small, 25 ml bottles during the holidays. This was a blind buy for me, as the Clinique counter I went to didn’t have a tester. The woman working at the counter actually tried to dissuade me from purchasing this, describing it as “very strong.” She wasn’t wrong, it is a strong, very long lasting fragrance. One spray is all you need and will last all day. Like most Clinique fragrances, you’ll either love it or hate it, and I love it. \n\nThere are so many different aspects of this fragrance. It has spicy aldehydic floral qualities to be sure, but because it has several green and woody notes and is in the water family of the fragrance wheel it smells very fresh and bright. Wrappings reminds me of going for a walk in the woods or in a park on a cold, clear winter day. It’s fresh, green, and wintery and perfect for wearing in cold weather.', ""ChelleBelle8404/10/20 17:38This fragrance brings back happy times at Christmas. Do NOT wear this when it's warm or hot. It will smell disgusting. This is very much a Christmas scent to be worn in cold weather for the holidays with a sweater and coat. Less is more because it's also a strong woody fragrance made to smell like fir (Christmas) trees. My mother years ago thought I sprayed a Christmas tree scent in my room. Come to find out it was this. Clung to my sweaters that I wore to Christmas parties. Smells very festive. On the right chemistry, this is wonderful, but again, only when it's cold."", 'Dmarie32902/04/20 08:59Ohhh what is this... I ordered it and received it today. Is this even perfume? It smells so disgusting. No more blind buys from Clinique for me.', 'LisaLovesPerfume01/16/20 20:23Currently on the Clinique website, the Wrappings gift set is only 35.00. I would order as soon as possible because I am sure they will sell out very soon! Happy shopping!', 'SheilaAnne01/16/20 19:11I wear Aromatic Elixir and decided to order this perfume. They have a lot of the same notes therefore, should be close to the same smell. I am sure, I will be pleased.', 'Anamandy01/12/20 00:01I purchased this on clearance at Macy’s this week so if anyone wants to buy this now is the time while it’s half price. They are also throwing in a bonus and offering free shipping to sweeten the deal. Can’t go wrong with that. \n\nOn me the first time use was a blast of citrus then something that smelled disturbingly like cat urine, though I think it might be a pine note or something like it not listed in the notes. Fortunately, that quickly passed and this became a very green and mossy fragrance, though not earthy or floral. It reminds me of Coriandre minus the floral notes. If there are florals in this they are so subdued they are barely perceptible. To me this is mainly an aromatic green scent. \n\nI had to do some errands and ran into a store to pick up an item. Coming in from the cold and waiting on line I suddenly smelled something wonderful and thought to myself, “boy, some guy behind me smells good.” I turned around and saw there was only a child and it certainly wasn’t her wearing the perfume, then realized in shock that it was me. That I thought this was a man’s fragrance threw me. It certainly smells masculine to me. It’s not like Cabochard which, though marketed for women, is really unisex and smells feminine or masculine depending on the user. This smells decidedly masculine to me. At the very least it’s unisex. While I like it a lot, I’m not sure I want to smell like a man’s cologne so this will get passed on to my nephew who is just starting out on his fragrance journey. I think he’ll appreciate it more than I do.', 'Eva Behari12/20/19 01:56I was so ecxited to try this one based on the good reviews here. Very disappointed. Its a shampoo kind of smell and no sillage whatsoever.In one hour or so it becomes a skin shampoo scent.Not worth it at all if you take in consideration what you pay for a Clinique perfume.Stop for me blind buying.', ""Olotitan12/13/19 19:24This is such a gorgeous scent and it's in season right now they only bring it out on Xmas time so for those of you who are lovers of Clinique Wrappings now it's the time to wrap yourself!\nGo to Macy's and online in the Clinique website. \n\nThis stuff is heavy and one of the most iconic perfumes I've ever smelled.\nIts a Floral Green aldehydic and Woody lush absolutely not for the shy IMO!"", 'Heretic_Housewife11/04/19 18:48I don\'t smell any floral notes, I consider it a fresh green aldehyde fragrance with a touch of wood and spice. \n\nIt doesn\'t smell like the holiday season to me, but reminds me of being in the forest after a rain. It\'s quite unique, I don\'t know of many fragrances that resemble it. \n\nI prefer the way it smells on my clothes and hair as opposed to how it smells on my skin. I think that\'s the aldehyde not playing well with my body chemistry. I do like the lotion though. I like to spray it on my collar and let my body heat warm and diffuse it. \n\nToo bad it\'s hard to find. I have started seeing holiday gift sets online since late October, so it\'s ""in season"" right now.', 'JenSin06/30/19 21:20Wrappings is stunning. It’s green and astringent. Once it warms up on your skin, it softens but remains persistent throughout the day. Good for all seasons and unisex. It only comes out at Christmas time in a gift set. Sample on your skin first. Let it settle for 30 to 60 mins. If you like it, you can get it for half off at Macy’s, Lord and Taylor’s or the Clinique website in early January through February.', ""mmmmgood04/29/19 17:24Shampoo-ish, and very green/fresh smelling. You can tell it's closely related to Aromatics Elixir, sans the bitterness of Elixir. I like this...I can wear this with a white shirt and jeans, and feel perfectly comfortable."", ""el-bi03/06/19 09:57there is nothing in the entire world that smells like wrappings.\nno other perfume can replace this miracle. \nsmells like a forest after the rain but with a hint of a burning fireplace mixed with feminine notes !!!i wish i could find the words to describe this miracle.\nit's the only perfume i keep buying over and over again for the last 7 years and believe me ,i have a huge perfume collection."", ""pfcs02/02/19 00:07Although I wear mostly scents by Clinique and Lauder, I had not tried this until a recent purchase was delivered today. It smells slightly odd at first, but is obviously of quality ingredients and has staying power. It reminds me of Aromatics Elixir or Wood Mystique, both of which I wear. It's a shame it is only sold near the holidays and only in a small bottle. I'll probably order it every year now."", ""Elsee01/22/19 16:45Got this at a great Macy's clearance sale. \nHmmm...well, it resembles Estee's Private Collection and Chanel's Cristalle...but, the initial spray makes you wonder why you sprayed it in the first place! Ugh. \n\nAll of a sudden......the magic happens. BUT it takes about 25 minutes to happen! Drives me crazy! If I sprayed this on before I left the house it would be okay for work. BUT I need to hug and kiss my hubby goodbye BEFORE I spray it. He would not like this at all....\n\nIt's original and good but very high maintenance!

I can't help but love it as much as I did 25 years ago but I absolutely cannot put my finger on why. It is unique. It's avant-gard, it's everything I hate in a scent, yet I love it. That once in a lifetime fluke where the stars align. Sublime."", 'CAMELOT10/27/18 10:54My friend and I discovered this in the 90s and we both loved it. It is the only perfume that I can remember strangers commenting on and this happened twice - the same thing happened to her. It is very green and fresh and unusual, nothing like the modern gourmand-type perfumes that are so common today.', 'sjcita05/12/18 18:06I ordered this from the Clinique website in a set that comes with a body cream. To me this smells soooo similar to a scent called Earth that was produced by the Gap years and years ago and came in a very small metal canister (which I still have)-- very green and pungent with great lasting power. Wrappings is sophisticated and long lasting with a fresh green blast that becomes softer and quieter as time goes on. I suppose it could be worn as an everyday scent, but really seems more suited to a night out.', ""nellyrlight02/12/18 07:51Can't believe I didn't know about this beauty! Absolutely amazing!! Can't find it in larger sizes..Please give feedback if you know anything."", ""Tovah10/24/17 22:01It's Clinique Wrappings Time! It's now in Macys, Nordstrom, Saks, and Bloomingdales.

I don\'t think it\'s been discontinued, though. I know here in the USA Wrappings is on all the department store shelves as well as Clinique\'s on-line store during November-December (during ""wrapped gift""-giving holidays). Wrappings is a beautiful, classic floral aldehyde that connotes skiing in the mountains on a sunny day. These days, it\'s almost too striking and beautiful to sell all the time, because people choose smell regularly like Gain laundry detergent.

If I had known it was being D/C'd those years ago, I would have stocked up. Somehow I was caught up with other perfumes by then and didn't have a clue it was going out- I didn't even think that a perfume this good would ever be in danger of going out ...can't even believe Clinique would end such a quality perfume.

First, a blast of pine, then lovely oakmossy greeness. Other subtle things are going on, but it's the oakmoss that stays dominant throughout, on me and that makes me happy. I agree that this evokes Vero Profumo's Mito, as I'm wearing both Wrappings and Mito right now for comparison, but where Wrappings is more on the dry side, Mito seems a tad more spicy and has a kind of champagne-like effervescence.

When Clinique discontinued this scent almost two decades ago, I loaded up on several bottles and have just one left of the perfume and two of the body lotion. I saw it in Perfumania stores and Clinique counters a few times during the holidays. What a shame that Clinique has only offered new scents that are floral and teenager friendly. Aromatiques is still a classic, but was never a friendly choice for my chemistry. I wish Clinique or Estee Lauder would bring it back like they did for Prescriptives Calyx---another great scent which is the complete opposite of Wrappings, but truly unique in its blend of green and fresh.

I apply blue mascara and blue eye pencil, I put on my Uno più Due dark- blue high heel s, a sexy black top and Wrapping, my signature perfume. The place is already full when we get there, my friends, some of my University students, artists, bohemians. We drink cheap beer with frozen vodka, and munch on French fries.

Weird. Wrappings is an interesting floral/green chypre that works totally well as a unisex fragrance, although it does smell a wee bit dated.\n\nBasically it opens a lot like Estee Lauder Private Collection with a big shot of pine on top (like a Christmas tree) with a bit of citrus. Otherwise just a HUGE blast of green and aldehydes, and within five minutes, the pine is all but gone and what's left is a weird mutant cross between Private Collection and Diorella. Like most Lauder fragrances, it lasts a really long time and projects extremely well, so go easy on it.\n\nThe version I'm trying doesn't list oakmoss on the ingredients, so it probably doesn't smell as good as it used to, but if you're into classic floral/green chypres, or, you like Diorella but you're not into the melon note, this one might be for you.

I would not classify it as an aldehydic perfume because I cannot recognize any aldehydes in the whole composition. Moreover it doesn’t remind me the Christmas season or a winter day and that’s the reason I have not worn it since October. On the contrary, although it’s woody, I feel it so green and cool that I consider it ideal for a sunny April day as today is. I believe that it suits well the Mediterranean spring. The bottle I have is from 90’s as the Christmas limited edition never reached my country and I keep it as a crown jewel because it’s only 25ml and I’m afraid that I will never find it again in the market. It was one of the most exceptional perfumes of that decade and it still remains unique.

All in all this doesn't blow me away as a cool'mood'scent like No 19 does, but acts a little more as an extension of a shower, or mimics coming indoors from outdoors. It smells clean without being mean because of the little nutmeg kick that is in its base, it's natural and light. However, I will reserve it for day time use only as the sillage and longevity are close to the skin and it's not really knockout for night as I like 'em.

It is not that well known which is the reason I have only accidentally come across it recently. I acquired a bottle at a really good price from a store employee that got it for herself and thought it was a limited edition AE. I love Aromatics Elixir as well, especially the new limited edition which I recently bought and since my mom loves every version of AE I wanted to get her a bottle. As it turned out it was Wrappings and I expected not to like it but I have instantly fallen in love with it. This is a very unique fragrance, nothing you will come across is like this, except maybe for AE as I do detect similarities in the base of the regular AE and Wrappings but I prefer Wrappings for is complexity and stronger floral notes. It is not a cold scent in my opinion since the flowers and warm base add warmth and it is surprisingly feminine which I thought would not be the case. A very special fragrance and a wonderful composition, which has never gotten enough attention, perhaps due to the fact that it was only available during the holidays and I believe that it is now discontinued so I am sure glad that I have gotten my bottle and in fact am searching for one for my mom now.

Such a warm, comforting scent that has tremendous staying power and a beautiful drydown.', 'evelynave06/12/21 09:02The most recent version of wrappings I have dates back about five years ago. It has the brilliant frosty brightness of Chanel No. 22, a kind of glare that would make you squint outdoors. It smells of cypress and first-to-spring-up florals under even fresher sheets of splintering ice.\n\nThe 1990 original involved a much lighter jacket. It was brisk; more in-between seasonally. The light was more afternoon sun, and the snow was starting to melt and drip from the tree branches. Saps and resins were a crucial part of that effect. This steered the fragrance closer to the more-chilly-than-cold evergreen climate of Bill Blass and Private Collection. It’s unlikely anyone would have drawn comparisons between the original Wrappings and No. 22; the relationship to Aromatics Elixir was far deeper then than now.\n\nAromatics Elixir was almost twenty years old when Wrappings first came out; whereas the oceanic craze was just cresting. Escape came out the year after Wrappings, and it’s interesting to think of Wrappings as a bridge between old and new; Clinique trying to keep up with the market at the time. Wrappings transplants its water from the beach to the foliage of the great outdoors.\n\nBoth bottles of Wrappings I have, old and far less old, are worth having, like slightly different flankers of each other. There aren’t very many scents that capture the emotional experience of climate and place this specifically. Wrappings puts you inside a scene you animate with memory and imaginative longing. The older version for me is a certain kind of afternoon in my Midwest adolescence—at the far end of an oppressive, shut-in winter, when the trees and nature are first gasping back to life, warmed awake by the sun. The newer version is the morning after a third or fourth heavy snow, a vista of white and the blinding sun it amplifies in every direction, a sense of being out in the wide open but bundled up to hold your own in it.', ""TillyWave_archive12/30/12 14:40At my age, the year 1990 seems to have only passed by a few days ago, but then I think about it longer, and realize that it's been 22 years since Wrappings was first released.

Bottles are simple and gorgeous.\nI find it impressive how they were so ahead of the trends being launched around 2014-16 with all the notes like labdanum and the oriental leaning musk, amber, peppery notes which also make them smell unisex to me although marketed as female perfumes. \nThis one out of the 3 flankers is the most unisex for my taste, it does have a boozy smell however no liquor is listed in the notes, which makes me think of Frank Boclet Vinyl. I am not saying it is a dupe but gives the same vibe to me. The cherry note is noticeable but not dominant, and it is a dry and musky interpretation rather than a juicy, fruity cherry note.\nDefinitely for colder weather', 'achatina02/14/23 08:40If you miss it just buy Bohobogo perfumes Wet cherry Liquor.

As this scent profile is trending right now.', ""SailorV04/01/22 12:49A darker take on cherry that combines candied fruitiness with bitter and spicy notes. This is not a simple cherry solinote at all! The cherry note here reminds me of cough drops, syrup or even chapsticks and lip gloss at first, it's very sweet and does not have the juiciness of a fresh cherry. But the rest of the scent is more serious and the cherry also shows its tart and sour side after a while. I get heaps of black pepper and cardamom. Both are quite dry and sharp, they almost feel like wood smoke. The bitterness of galbanum only adds to that. Cashmeran and amber on the other hand give the scent a warm and creamy base. There are really 3 distinctive accords in this: Sweet and sour cherry, dry spices and a creamy ambery backdrop. Add a little rose to bring things together, and there you go, it's Aromatics Black Cherry. As a whole this is definitely more complex than your average cherry perfume. \n\nFor my personal taste the blend is a little too chaotic, at least for the first hours. Especially the cashmeran sticks out too much and should have been dialed down. I still enjoy this enough to rate it as a like, but my number one holy grail cherry perfume will always be TF Lost Cherry and this doesn't come close. If you prefer drier, spicier, less juicy takes on fruit I would still recommend Aromatics Black Cherry, provided you can find it for a reasonable price."", ""karlee7901/26/22 20:14Heavy duty Arabian cherry fragrance, notes are missing true oud , like mega , I almost can't stand it but it's reminence is unforgettable of pipe tobacco and cherry insence"", 'miZZpuRRfect09/23/21 02:02I had it and it but gave it away to my mother in law because it was way too green and earthy for me.

It was sweetened, softer and not surgary. Sillage was from 4pm to next morning. It's not a musky cherry but it's a good night-out-on-the town evening fragrance. No one will guess what you are wearing! You have to put this on a hour or so before walking out the door! It can be a beast if over sprayed! My hubby, the critic, said it smelled good! He loved it and so do I! Unique she is and womanly! Yes!"", ""KowltheOwl06/17/20 15:51I blind bought this but not my favorite. I get mostly medicinal cherries as some others have said.

The cherry note is wonderful, and it does dry down to a nicely elegant warm and sweet semi-gourmand with woody/spicy underpinning - it's really aptly named now that I think of it! But in the opening it can very easily become too much for me; the warmth here is of the sensual rather than the cosy kind, and because it's so intense it's making me feel borderline feverish at times... I'm going to keep my sample to try again in the depth of winter, when I think it might be glorious when used in the right mood (and in small quantities!)"", 'Austrian_in_Denmark05/06/20 05:45I have a complicated relationship with cherries. \nHaving grown up in the countryside, in a house with a garden that hosts two big cherry trees, I know they taste and smell amazing. \n\nBut I also know that cherries that have never seen a drop of pesticide can contain a lot of worms. And I mean: A LOT of worms. Eating numerous home-made cherry desserts, where the unmistakable presence of worms was vehemently denied by all relatives over the age of 30, has given me a low-level but long-lasting cherry trauma. \n\nScents such as Aromatics Black Cherry enable me to enjoy the lovely aroma of cherries - very sweet and sour in this case - without being confronted with worms. Apart from the cherries that are on the forefront from start to finish, Black Cherry smells like incense and spices. It is a dark, deep and soothing scent. And has no worms. \n\nVery longlasting with heavy sillage.', ""kumquat211/20/19 07:46This is like two separate perfumes. There is the nearly hour long opening which, to me, is absolutely horrendous. It's very similar to the original AE's opening, but thank god, doesn't last as long. It's disturbingly medicinal, and not like a cherry cough drop, like a dentist's office. Like you just rinsed with something vile and spit in a sink and now desperately want to go home. I gave in to that panic at the 40 minute mark and a rubbed it off my wrist with unscented lotion. Amazingly, it now smelled delightful! Spicy, warm and sweet, like a cherry pie with wood underneath. Can't figure it out. But even after scrubbing the beautiful smell lasted four more hours and got prettier and prettier. The bottle is gorgeous and feels good in your hands. Just have too much dread of that opening to try it again."", ""skeletoff11/15/19 15:19This is a weird one! I like it. It opens up pretty harsh...reminiscent of portapotty air freshener.

It\'s a very warm scent, deep and dark. \n\nIt starts with some sharp spicy bitter sweet cherry. Not a fruity organic cherry, mind you, it\'s more like a cherry flavour you\'d get from a cherry tobacco or a cherry flavoured liquor. Maybe even a little ""plummy"" at times?\n\nAfter the initial heady start the cherry tones down but it\'s always there in the woodsy background. It eventually gets more and more smoky. \n\nVery long lasting with moderate sillage if you keep a very light hand, at the end of the day it\'s close to skin even though it\'s still strong. I get some surprised wiffs and wows from people when they get too close to my personal space. \n\nIt would probably be VERY noticeable and loud if you are not careful with it but then I feel it\'s kinda suffocating - but that\'s probably just me being sensitive as always (have severe migraines).\n\nWhomever said it\'s for a sorceress is pretty right. \n\nI feel mysterious when I\'m wearing it. I especially like it in the late fall and early winter. It\'s just a great chilly and dry weather fume.', 'PaperGhost09/30/18 02:56This is a strange one. I like the original Aromatics Elixir And Aromatics in White, so I bought a mini of this to try it. \n\nI get no cherry at all. For the first 45 minutes all I get from it is medicinal coconut, if you can imagine such a thing. Even my husband described it as ‘hospital grade coconut’. Eventually it settles down into quite a pleasant tobacco smell, but I don’t like it enough to tolerate the first 45 minutes.', 'Arbu05/27/18 07:44Blind buy. Oh, i wanted to love it so much!

I finally got my hands on a sample, settled in for a test run and .... meh.\n\nIt has a Cherry Coke vibe, and it dries down to something pretty. Not even close to the bombastic AE. Where's the spice, the heady smoky goodness? Where's the sexy and the wow?\n\nI had hoped for AE with a deep cherry in the mix, something deep and fruity and wintry. Something to wear while warming toes by the fire. This is almost a summery scent - fresh and flowery, with very little spice.\n\nI can't get past the Lip Smacker Cherry Cola scent. Not in this scent. This should have been and could have been so much more.\n\nIt's pretty, and it's very wearable, and if you're looking for a fruity anti AE, here it is.

I don't do that very often, but I'm a huge fan of Aromatics Elixir and I really had a good feeling about this line. Ok... so here goes my thoughts. \nFirst thing, what a gorgeous red bottle! I got the largest one I could find on Ebay. So glad I did! I wish I could place it in my window sill just to be able to look at that beautiful red glass! I love this juice!!! Definitely cherry tobacco! It's smoky, delicious cherry immediately, then a light floral with a sweet, fruity,delicious center. Not a scent you would smell on a teenager!This is not one of those cookie cutter frags. It's mature, it's original, it's difficult to compare. Smells expensive and exclusive.

Not even close. The cherry here is dark, deep and smoky, think more cherry pipe tobacco and not a cherry lifesaver. I wouldn't even call this fruity at all. Its more like a heavy syrupy musky floral. In a way the opening reminds me of the original M7, as this def has a cherry coke/Tom Ford feel to it. As powerful and potentially unisex as this starts off, it tames down after 45 mins. Then it becomes a soft and waxy white floral, the dry down becomes much more feminine and it's pretty sweet from beginning to end. Very complex and very interesting stuff, I do like this. It's a high quality and distinctive scent and the longevity is very good. And I don't know if this is good or bad, but doesn't smell at all like it came from Clinique. Too bad its so hard so find, if this was mainstream it could find a bigger audience.

Only available in a stopper bottle and now evidently hard-to-find. If it is truly close to the original, though, purists may want to give it a try. I am curious about it myself, because I wore the 1971 original but cannot tolerate subsequent reformulations.', ""jenise12/26/17 06:34I obtained this beautiful brown bottle on Ebay, it was a blind buy. It is absolutely lovely. I found it very similar to the original AE. This is a scent to use sparingly. Be careful opening the bottle, as it is a stopper. If you love AE, I promise you will love this too. It has a strong silage, and is very long lasting on my skin. Patch is awesome, must be a patch lover to wear this. \nI find that when I wear a strong frag, I wear it low, around my belly button, or even lower, my legs. It wafts upwards, and is toned down through my clothes so it rarely ever offends anyone else and I get delicious whiffs all day long. I recommend wearing all AE frags this way. This perfume is exactly as described in the notes. It has a bit more floral to it than the original. I love the bottle, I love it in my collection. Best blind buy ever.

I say update because it has clearly been tweaked to be more compatible with today's market.

I accidentally spilt a lot of this down the front of my shirt when testing, and the next day I could barely smell it.

One of my coworkers and I would amuse ourselves on a slow day by surreptitiously giving each other a squirt, laughing like maniacs and running away. We did this as a joke because we hated the scent of Aromatics Elixir. Then, something happened. I began chatting with the women that would come in to buy it and for almost every one of them, this was their signature scent. I grew to love it and when you can smell it on someone whose chemistry it mixes with, it's truly intoxicating. I've tried over and over again in the intervening years to make this one of the scents in my rotation, but it never worked for me. Definitely got the bug spray vibe. However, I purchased this LE of the Perfumers Reserve and I finally can wear AE!!!! Bottle is gorgeous and using the stopper to dab a bit on my neck makes me feel old school glamorous. This is smoother than the original, I think the sillage is closer, but still considerable. Long lasting? Yes. I often wear it to bed and sniff my wrists as I'm drifting off. It is much better after the first half hour and on me, I get the patchouli and vetiver, delicious. Probably not an office scent, but amazing in colder weather to snuggle up with your sweetie. It definitely doesn't smell like fruity candy, this is for grownups and I think it would be fantastic on a man."", ""lovingthealien08/25/12 17:46A surprisingly excellent chypre considering when it was released. It's very much an excellent and high quality classic chypre similar to Sous le Vent or Mitsouko with a touch of the original Aromatics Elixir just barely showing through. Though not too close to the original AE (which is already in parfum strength, isn't it?), it's still absolutely wonderful. The rose/patchouli accord so prominently smoldering in the original has become a light accent in this version which is extremely sexy in its own right. \n\nApply judiciously; this does in dabs what the original does in large sprays.\n\nAbsolutely recommended."", ""OVincze12/21/11 03:45I agree that this LE is definitely worth it and like a fine single barrel scotch.

There is spice in this frag but it is muted. It opens with the most beautiful rose and the only thing I would change is that I would keep most of that rose in the heart. The opening is really beautiful and complicated and the dry down is less complicated but very warm, still very different and simply stunning. \n\nWhat I also love about the LE is that it is a perfume concentrate, the price is great for that and with such a deep frag application is much easier than if it had been in a spray bottle.

At first I thought UGH....what a waste of $75!!! But....then I realized there is an art to wearing this version. The first dab was straight from the bottle. OMG - NO!!! It's too strong and smells weird. So then I tried dabbing a kleenex, letting it dry somewhat and then dabbing it on my wrist. There it is. Pure joy. \n\nIt's a VERY STRONG version of the juice so go slow, dab lightly and figure out what works on you.

Hope this sells well enough to become a permanent addition, instead of a temporary limited edition."", ""melancholybaby10/15/11 17:05The Perfumer's Reserve version of Aromatics Elixir is presented in a lovely brown glass bottle, etched with flowers; the stopper acts as a pulse-point dropped for the perfume. While the fragrance is certainly recognizable in the same line as the original, there is a subtle, smooth almost velvet-like aspect of this version that surrounds you and makes you feel oh-so-sexy in a quiet way. It is closer to the skin than the original, and in comparing the two this reminds me of the difference between Johnny Walker and a fine, 20-year old single malt.

There is a very strong but way to brief reference to the current EdP version in the opening, although quite a bit lighter on the patchouli side. It vanishes very fast and sinks int a salty, musky skin scent. The rose is withering for a tad longer, but lovely as it is, it is also gone before you know it. \nI'm comparing EdP to this and they have an entirely different drydown. This one is very salty and sultry with a just a dash of vetiver on its best behaviour. From this phase alone one could never guess that this perfume is supposed to belong to the AE line.

Aromatics in White was launched in 2014. The nose behind this fragrance is Nicolas Beaulieu. Top notes are Labdanum, Sichuan Pepper and Violet Leaf; middle notes are Rose, Patchouli and Orange Blossom; base notes are Musk, Amber, Benzoin and Vanilla. White color definitely replaces the years-long trend of black color. One fragrance in the long line of very interesting editions arrives from the house of Clinique as a successor of the classic from 1971—Aromatics Elixir. As the oldest fragrance of the house of Clinique, Aromatics Elixir takes special place in the collection of the house but also an envious place for the quality of the composition in the perfume industry in general. Its chypre-floral composition highlights tart floral essences of carnation and rose, cooled with aldehydes and moss. 

The opulence of aromas of Aromatics Elixir has been modernized with Aromatics Elixir Sheer Velvet Philtre Sensuel from 2006 and Aromatics Elixir Perfumer's Reserve from 2011, and in Autumn 2014 the new face of the first Clinique fragrance receives sophisticated contemporary style. 

""I have always been fascinated with the magic of Aromatics Elixir and its attraction on the skin. I wanted to convey that feeling with a new, modern composition,"" stated perfumer Nicolas Beaulieu on the occasion of creating Aromatics in White.

In October 2014 Clinique presents Aromatics in White, a women’s fragrance which lures with tart notes of Sichuan pepper, elegant violet leaves and labdanum in top notes. The gentle transition towards the heart comes with floral shades of roses and orange blossom, surrounded with patchouli, creating a harmonious union of floral and earthy textures. Depth and sensual aromas are ensured by leather musk, intertwined with warm grey amber, benzoin and vanilla. United this way, they leave a soft, oriental signature in the base. The new composition by Clinique is signed by perfumer Nicolas Beaulieu.

Fragrance Aromatics in White arrives in a white flacon following the style and form of its antecedents, and has been modernized with an elegant white cap. The flacon has been embellished discretely with golden color details (a thin rim on the cap and name inscribed in gold). Expected on the market on November 1, 2014.Read about this perfume in other languages: Deutsch, Español, Français, Čeština, Italiano, Русский, Polski, Português, Ελληνικά, 汉语, Nederlands, Srpski, Română, العربية, Українська, Монгол, עברית.",PerfumerNicolas Beaulieu,

It's a freshy but that's really the only similarity in my opinion that they share. Imo they don't share any dna. You can smell the carrot in the original this is very linear compared to the original also. Great for summer but it's not the one I wanted."", 'petrova_8704/19/23 03:46cannot be compared to the classic one. not my scent', ""AMMILLER04/01/23 11:01This grew on me. At first I thought it smelled generic, like the scented strips of paper that used to come in magazines, but it's so fresh and sparkling. It opens with a burst of orange but quickly settles into an orange floral that is just pretty. Also I've gotten several compliments while wearing this, mainly from my coworkers, which is rare."", ""ava9603/21/23 02:10I feel like Clinique fragrances are kind of underrated. My mom still has a tiny bit left of Clinique Happy in Bloom and it's such a nice, happy scent. \nThis one reminds me of Happy in Bloom slightly, it's not the same but they are definitely siblings.\nFresh watery floral - very good when you don't feel like wearing a show-stopping scent, but something pleasant, fresh and happy."", ""midnightauro01/11/23 04:45I remember wearing this a few years ago and it was pleasant if a little soapy. It was quite nice! I tried it again recently and now that I've aged, it's turned absolutely screechy on my body. In the bottle it's a beautiful scent but my skin turns it to an acidic punch in the nose that managed to give me a headache.

Happy heart is less floral, a bit more refreshing and well balanced.', ""d3athtul1ps11/30/22 06:47I was so nervous to try this one because I loved the 2003 formula, it was one of my favorites for a long time, but my anxiety lasted only as long as it took for this formula to sink into my skin. It's so lovely and addicting, I can't get enough of the scent. The sillage is big and juicy. The aquatic note comes through most strongly on my skin, it's so fresh and wet, a bit earthy, the choice of water hyacinth for the floral note complements it nicely. \n\nThe woody base note carries it all nicely and the ozonic smell makes it almost ethereal. The blend is so perfect and lovely, this is one of my new top favorites. I got a travel size bottle because I was nervous about the new formula, but I'm definitely going to be getting a larger one asap. Longevity isn't the best, only around 6 hours on my skin, but still good."", ""piqpar11/27/22 08:49I love this scent.

Lasts all day."", ""bellereve08/22/22 18:35I'm not too familiar with aquatic profiles when it comes to fragrances but I can say that this is a lovely fresh floral. I think the cucumber note gives it that aquatic quality. It's so light yet sweet and feminine. A beautiful clean scent. The woody base notes give the scent some depth as it dries down but the scent does stay very consistent from opening to its drying down. It lasts very well on the skin and even better on clothes. It seemed like every time I turned my head or waved an arm, I'd get a lovely reminder of the scent. I really like this fragrance. It's an easy grab and easy-going scent, that definitely makes you feel fresh and upbeat"", 'Amalfihereim08/04/22 12:14I have this parfum and smells stunning, DOES NOT smell like a wet dog (I have a dog and I know what I’m talking about) . This parfum is very beautiful, this parfumé smells similar with Wind Flowers by Creed , but more delicate, more feminine, more uplifting. It’s unique too and to me is like the fresh smell of a white lily . Incredible beautiful, also the dry down it’s absolutely gorgeous, it’s like camay soap, very beautiful', ""sparklyunicorn08/01/22 10:01This perfume was a gift and I am trying so hard to like it. However, I am picking up on a really unpleasant undertone that is 'pee' like or 'pissy' if you will. I am not really that sensitive to that and I have so many vintage perfumes. The 'wet dog' comment below resonated with me. It is a shame because otherwise it's a nice aquatic floral. Oh well."", 'Mirille06/24/22 09:40Light, pleasant, and soapy. I wish the mandarin came through a bit more, but overall, it is soft and calming. The price is relatively reasonable, so I think it would not be a bad choice for a day to day scent.', 'ckorp806/14/22 06:19A soft fresh non obtrusive fragrance. Non powdery, just relaxing soft scent. A good choice to wear if you need to blend into the crowd at a party, not wanting to really stand out but not just be too plain either. It can also be used to layer with other soft perfumes. I tried Eau Duelle EdT and it was a good blend.', 'crea1105/22/22 09:26I sampled this at Ulta, it smells WONDERFUL on the test strip, pure hyacinths. I sprayed it on myself to test the longevity and like mentioned below it smelled really off on my skin, I understand the wet dog comment. I’ll try spraying it on my clothes next time. For that reason I would say this is not a safe blind buy.', 'Melaniesherriff04/26/22 01:58This is my signature scent. It lasts all day and into the night on me. Cool Citrusy fresh. Loads of compliments when wearing this. It smells the same from beginning to end of day does not fade', 'Hair2show04/23/22 18:03This smells like wet dog to me.

It was made in 2013 :/', 'lesritesdelavie01/15/22 13:38This used to be my signature scent for a few years. It is a spring-summer scent but I used to use it throughout my seasonal depression winters - it truly does lift ones mood. It makes one feel as the sun came out.\nIt is slightly sweeter and more citric but rather similar to Versace Bright Crystal.', 'chezzig0101/13/22 06:31I Bought it on sale about 9 months ago and wear the OG happy from time to time too. This is such an easy Fragrance for me to wear in Summer. Not too floral , its fresh, aquatic with just the right amount of sweetness. Funnily enough...My most complimented fragrance of all time!! I always get asked what im wearing compliments on the way I smell. Couldnt be happier as its relatively inexpensive, where Im from , to replace a bottle when it runs out . Ive worn this exclusively for months now .', 'pretty mini collector01/02/22 09:16This sits between Cool Water, DKNY Be Delicious Blossom, and The Beat. It grabbed the best parts of each of these beauties and made something spectacular. It’s warm and cool, beachy sand and cashmere sweater. I would definitely invest in a full size bottle of this.', ""cecejras03/23/21 22:00Everyone is calling this soapy. I agree. However, my initial thought when I first tested Happy Heart was that this is similar to Happy, but has a beachy, sunscreen vibe happening, where Happy doesn't."", 'sda1148902/10/21 18:58This is one of the most underrated perfumes! It is absolutely beautiful, and I get compliments from every time I wear it. I’m surprised sometimes that people can smell it on me in public even while they are wearing a mask. This is a fresh, slightly sweet, and slightly warm fragrance. It smells like a beautiful sunny spring day and a warm hug. It’s very feminine, and it’s one of my husband’s favorite perfumes on me. Clinique Happy is my signature fragrance, but this one is my second favorite perfume. After pregnancy and having my son, I can’t tolerate many perfumes for some reason, but Clinique Happy and Happy Heart never bother me or anyone around me. I never sneeze or have people around me sneeze while I’m wearing these perfumes either. Definitely give this a try if you like fresh floral fragrances and want to smell beautiful all day.', ""bathcatz02/03/21 17:09Have worn and loved this scent for years. Always got compliments on it as it was my everyday scent. I noticed it is very similar to DKNY fresh blossom the only difference being the mandarin orange note which fresh blossom doesn't have. Now I think I've outgrown happy hearts citrus floral notes and would prefer fresh blossom since it is a bit more citrus woodsy."", 'SeauxGood07/21/20 17:16I like this, but don’t love it. Classic case of loving a product in the store, but not so much once you get it home. The initial notes are bright and kind of sporty (probably the mandarin orange), but the dry down smells like a hair conditioner. Still mulling over returning it to the store. I do have some body lotions it might layer over nicely, but I shouldn’t have to MAKE a fragrance smell better. I’m glad I didn’t pay more for it.', 'Lavandermilk06/24/20 05:35I feel like this scent could be liked by a lot of people but for me, it is a hard no. \n\nIt reminds me of Versace brigh crystal, which I also dislike. Probably because peony smells sort of soapy & this does as well.\n\nI LOVE the OG clinique happy. The only other scent I adore just as equally is YSL Libre, and that is it. Those are the only two scents I could wear all the time and be completely content. I obviously don\'t think as highly of this. \n\nTo me, it\'s just a boring and simple floral. The ""fizziness"" iv seen people talk about just gives it this nauseating quality that makes me think of cheap shampoo that got into my mouth, pink synthetic dollar store perfume, or like an older lady who is trying to smell young and hip.\n\nI think this scent is super safe and probably likable to most people but I cannot sugarcoat my dislike for it.', 'raiza199002/18/20 09:47Starts fresh and a bit sweet, then gets powdery and a bit spicy and then turns fresh and sweet again. I like the opening and the drydown. The heart not so much. It’s a nice fragrance but nothing spetacular. \nFinal note: 6/10', 'Rosemary1405/08/19 08:51This fragrance is ozonic, watery, and a little soapy. There is a bug spray quality to it that I used to not mind. I smelled this on a girl several years ago and liked it. It has a clean vibe that is reminiscent of shampoo or a just out of the shower feel. To me this is more like a body spray than a perfume. It has brief longevity of about 2-3 hours. I’ve really grown out of this fragrance, but it was a nice beginner fragrance for me that helped me grow and figure out what is right for me. I think it’s good for after the gym or just running errands or good for a young person. It’s very unpretentious and fresh and great for people that don’t like heady or strong scents.', 'waskotransportation02/16/19 14:03Really enjoy regular Happy and I love soapy smelling frags, so I assumed this would be a winner. I blind bought the biggest bottle from QVC and now pretty much regret the purchase. It was far too much money for what you get.\n\nJust for reference my signature is Chloe New or Chloe Chloe. I have been on a mission to find other soapy floral/rose scents. This did seem very promising but not what I hoped it would be.\n\nIt smells during drydown a LITTLe bit soapy but mostly a generic floral with zero projection. Smells like a celebrity scent to me. Overpriced celeb scent is how I can best describe this one. \n\nBoring enough to wear everyday to any office. Even if you are not supposed to wear perfume at all, no one will even know this is perfume. Smells like a nice smelling hair product. Like but do not love.\n\nI have used it twice. Anyone want to trade for something in the same price range, please let me know.', ""AHeartLikeMine08/14/18 21:27I assume this is the version of Happy Heart that is in the Pops of Color set. If it is, it has a nice floral smell that I was certain was rose, but that's not in the notes. During the drydown, it get a metallic tang that I also noticed in the original Happy. That fades off, though. This is mostly a linear scent, as is Happy. Fresh, floral, feminine, vibrant, but not a sillage monster."", 'Gemini1207/29/17 15:50This one is an emphatic NO for me. It starts off reminiscent of the original Cinique Happy, which is a good thing, but a soapy floral note quickly overpowers the citrus.

I just bought a bottle, & it smells the exact same as it always has. I will say this. The flower oils they use, go bad fast. I am assuming that it the reason they reformulated ""Happy"" early last yr & ""Tweaked"" Bloom in 2014. Happy barely counts as a body spray now. Horrible! My HG too. I DO know this. Size matters. There are 3 sizes of Bloom. The small one is going to be the weakest, the large is going to be the strongest. Fair? No, its not, especially since they hide that. The small bottles are often found at Ulta. They are very light. The LARGE Bloom will blow your socks off. Clinique isn\'t going to tell you this. I KNOW. As far as your older bottles smelling different, it is b/c it slowly turned before your nose & you didn\'t realize it. Or you bought a different size.

The lily of the valley and mimosa dominate the composition, so if those notes bother you then you probably won't care for this.

It is said from Clinique: “create a unique present when you put your own photo on the Clinique Happy bottle”. On their official site you can order the perfume and send them your favorite photo of you or your beloved, or anything else you prefer. All the information about the size of the photograph and anything else you can find on the site. Three simple steps will get you to the exquisite present.

It\'s a good way to personalize a gift (if you decide to give it as a gift). The perfume smells exactly the same...which is nice because I like the original Clinique Happy better than Happy Heart. It\'s fruity, fragrant, sweet (but not sugar sweet), and, in a way, somewhat uplifting. I think the plum and the apple (though I can\'t smell them individually) keep the fragrance from being too ""tart"" and maintain it\'s ""fresh"" smell. Again, I can\'t smell the different flowers individually, but they add a subtle, yet cute, floral note to the composition. The mimosa, amber and musk are what keep this perfume intriguing, though. It adds a sparkle to it...almost like a very innocent sparkling wine. Not champagne, but sparkling wine. It\'s young, vibrant, and full of pleasant sweetness.\n\nIt\'s not my go-to fragrance, but it\'s a pretty perfume that wouldn\'t be bad to use every day if you wanted to.']"

Orange, lemon, maybe a tinge of light flowers. Clean but bland. Happy like an emoticon. Pretty, but ultimately not very interesting; that's the worst I can say about this. It's not bad, just not great.\n\nThe scent is ungrounded. If it were music, it would be an unaccompanied flute solo that lasts half an hour. You keep wanting depth or development. If only it dried down to release something intriguing like nutmeg or grass or tea or wood, or even musk. That would be interesting. No, it is static.\n\nBut then again, even as much as I love the original Happy and Happy Heart, neither develops, at least on me. \nI am going to try layering this with an apricot-vanilla cologne from Comptoir Sud to see whether the combination could work.

I've always been a bit intrigued by their layering scents but hadn't really found them worth purchasing until I sampled Baby Bouquet. \n\nBaby Bouquet very much fits within the Happy fragrance family. It has that mandarin orange that connects them all and helps it smell fresh and... happy! But it contains notes that make it feel cozy, soapy, and perhaps a hint powdery without coming across like the pencil shavings or fabric softener. It strikes a delicate balance that prevents it from being too much.\n\nFor something with baby in the name, the mix of notes almost gives it a unisex quality — not too feminine, not too masculine, just somewhere in the middle, possibly leaning more feminine. But certainly, depending on how you layer it, it could go either way. That being said, it's lovely on its own.\n\nI don't see a comparison between this and Born Lovely, if I'm honest. I tried Born Lovely at a local Shoppers where you can currently snag it for $20 CAD and was almost instantly disappointed. They share mild similarities, but Baby Bouquet undoubtedly has the same DNA as Happy, whereas Born Lovely lacks these entirely (and, to be frank, smells like you would expect a cheapy perfume to smell)."", ""MetallicSquink11/25/22 15:53Smells exactly like Sarah Jessica Parker's Born Lovely, especially once it dries down."", 'YdeGirl11/22/22 19:21Spicy, powdery, bright.

The base notes of vetiver and amber wood are not heavy, just enough to lend it a hint of woodsiness. A very fresh unisex fragrance that is gorgeous without getting too sweet. People complain about longevity, but I’d say 3-4 hours for something that retails for $25 is very reasonable. This would be an excellent fragrance for summer vacation.', ""SteelerOpera04/12/19 23:31I really love this one, it was an instant purchase for me. This will be a fantastic fragrance for summer. The longevity isn't that great, but it is more than an hour for sure, I got over 4 hours and it was a compliment getter. If we look at the price per mL it's not that great, but at $22 it's more than worth it. One of the unsolicited complimenters was surprised when I told him (incorrectly) that this fragrance was for women, he said he would have never guessed. If you are a fan of a good neroli make sure you check this out!"", ""alit06/28/20 07:55This ts really really beautiful, fresh like air after rain, also strong resemblance to Neroli Portofino.. Too bad it doesn't last long, 2-3 hours tops.\nStill worth it for me though."", ""lmwimsatt04/13/19 00:20Did they finally add this line to the site??? About time... lol. This reminds me of flying by maison Martin replica, but it's much more nicely done""]"
